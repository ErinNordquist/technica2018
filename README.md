# Technica 2018 - Visionist "Health Matters" Challenge

[Visionist, Inc.](https://www.visionistinc.com/) is successfully applying years of experience creating custom software and analysis solutions to the health domain. We believe that modern healthcare and public health solutions will display up-to-date metrics in visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces to aid in better decision-making, treatments, and access to care. We challenge teams to join us in this important mission and **develop interesting data-driven technology solutions** to some of the health industryâ€™s most pressing problems.

# Criteria

Your solution must use at least one of the datasets below, but you are welcome to include any additional external data sources. Your solution can range from presenting interesting results in a slide show (explain the backing code), to a mobile application, to a webpage/SPA, or all the way to a interactive AR/VR experience. Don't simply display the data given. You must transform/combine the data to produce something new and interesting. Data science methods encouraged, but be able to explain what you've done!

# Prize

All members of the winning team will receive $50 Amazon gift cards to be furnished as soon as possible.

# Data

Data set may be either CSV or JSON. Each dataset may have an associated data dictionary which describes the fields, types, and relationships within that dataset. You may still need to explore the data to understand and make connections. We encourage reading over the dictionaries as the descriptions are much more in-depth than this brief summary listing.
