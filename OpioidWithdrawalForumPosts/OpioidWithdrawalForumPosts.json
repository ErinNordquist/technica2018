{"comment": "The purpose of this thread is to facilitate questions and discussion for anyone who is considering, in the midst of, or even just curious about, withdrawing from opiates.  Withdrawal is no picnic, however not knowing what to expect and what can be done to help ease the pain makes it that much worse.  Remember that no matter how terrible your symptoms may seem they are only temporary.  Countless people have been there before and have successfully come out the other side.  Armed with their knowledge, support, and experience, we'll help you get through it too.Some of the questions and topics which belong in this thread include:When taking opiates regularly over a period of time, your body becomes accustomed to them and develops both tolerance (where you need more opiates to achieve the same effects) and dependence (where you need opiates just to feel normal).  When a person who is dependent on opiates stops taking them or takes less than they require, they go into withdrawal.  The severity and duration of withdrawal depends on how long a person has been dependent, how high/strong the dose is that they are dependent on, and how long the half life of the opiate that they are taking is.PAWS (post acute withdrawal symptoms) begin after you have finished the physically painful withdrawal process.  They can continue to occur for an extended period of time especially in users who have been on opiates for a while.  PAWS generally consist of psychological problems like depression, anxiety, etc, which stem from chemical imbalances in your brain.is an excellent resource for those who are looking for information and support on this phenomena.It is important to note that almost all opioids taken for fun act primarily on the Mu-opioid receptor.  This means that there is a cross tolerance between them and taking large amounts of weak opiates can be considered almost the same as taking small amounts of strong opiates.There are three main methods that people use to try to get off of opioids.Going cold turkey (CT) is when consumption of all opiates is suddenly ceased and the person enters acute and full on withdrawal.  The advantage of this method over others is that the withdrawal is completed in the shortest amount of time.  The downside is the symptoms will be most severe.is when powerful antagonist are steadily administered to an opiate tolerant individual resulting in instant and extreme withdrawal.  This procedure actually condenses the acute withdrawal period, which usually lasts several days, into a matter of hours.  Due to the level of pain this inflicts upon the user however it requires a doctor to supervise and the patient is put under generally anesthesia (i.e. knocked out like for surgery) for the duration of the treatment.  These clinics are probably a very tempting option for most people however they are expensive, there are still PAWS to deal with, the chance of relapse is higher (because you never had to experience withdrawal), and there are risks similar to that of minor surgery.is a psychoactive plant that has potential for addiction treatment.  It is usually used to send the user on a long introspective psychedelic trip resulting in reduced cravings, lower tolerance, and abatement of withdrawal symptoms.  Like the rapid detox above there are clinics which specialize in ibogaine treatment depending on your location.Tapering is when progressively smaller amounts of opiates are taken over time in an attempt to slowly wean off the opiates and minimize negative symptoms.  This is probably the most common method of attempting to handle withdrawal and it can be performed over a time-span of anywhere from days to months.  The more gradual the taper, the more subtle the symptoms of withdrawal, but of course the longer it takes to complete.  At the end of the taper the user will eventually have to switch to zero opiates at some point.  This is called 'jumping off' and usually will result in some negative symptoms even if the last dose was very low.Some people will attempt to taper by switching from a strong opioid like oxycodone, fentanyl or heroin, to a weaker opioid like codeine or tramadol.  This way they can use the cross tolerance to help reduce the withdrawal symptoms but won't be as tempted to get high with their DOC (drug of choice) if they can even get high at all on the weaker opioids.  In some locations these opioids are available without a prescription.  Depending on your location these include:For some people getting off of opiates is too hard or is not as important as getting out of the drug culture and life style.  For them opiate maintenance is an option.  Opiate maintenance with methadone or buprenorphine is effectively a taper plan overseen by a doctor with the difference that some people choose not to taper for years, if at all, and just \"maintain\" themselves on the drugs.  Choosing to go on methadone or buprenorphine is difficult decision.  Many people find it helps them get off of opiates and many find it is more difficult to get off of their maintenance drug than it is their original drug of choice.People can choose to use methadone and/or buprenorphine in an at home withdrawal setting as well, however these drugs have very long half lives and other special properties which must be taken into account (which is why they have their own threads as linked below).  Buprenorphine has such a high affinity if taken while other opiates are still in your system it will rip them off and cause instant and painful 'precipitated withdrawal'.The second post of this thread includes most of what you would want to know about OTC and home remedies as well as other advice on dealing with withdrawal and is a good place to start (after reading this first post of course).Although this thread is designed for general questions, comments, and concerns on opiate withdrawal, before posting please review the following threads and see if your topic is more suited elsewhere.

{"comment": "There are only two ways to cure withdrawal.  The first is by taking more opiates and it is really not the answer we are looking for.  The second is time.  No matter what you do to help ease your way through withdrawal, the only real way to get better is over time.  During this time, since we can't directly treat the cause of the withdrawal by taking more opiates (or we only partially treat them if tapering), we treat the symptoms of opiate withdrawal.Supportive treatment is a term in medicine where if you can't treat the cause of a disease to cure it, you manage the symptoms as best you can.First and foremost (much like surviving on a desert island) we take care of our basic bodily needs.There are many drugs which are often available over the counter (without a prescription) that can do wonders for helping alleviate certain symptoms of opioid withdrawal.  Some of the more commonly used ones are listed here.Although the OTC drugs listed above do help with some symptoms, there are more potent prescription drugs which would be considered preferable; if you can get your hands on them.  The most notable of these are benzodiazepines which, depending on the specific one, can be a combination of a sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant.  Benzos are often prescribed by detox clinics and are definitely a good thing to have.Some others include:It is debatable whether substances like weed, booze, coke, ketamine, etc. should be taken during opiate withdrawal.  They have the potential to make the situation much worse, however they can help both with physical symptoms and with taking your mind off of withdrawal.  It basically comes down to a personal choice but anything that is hard on the body or has a hard comedown is probably not going to help anything (eg. stims and booze).  Smoking weed is probably the most common and can definitely help people relax and take their mind off the withdrawal but it does elevate your heart rate and can make anxiety worse.Endorphines are natural opioids created by your body in response to certain situations.  They are what is needed to get you feeling better again and there are several ways you can trigger their release.One of the worst things about withdrawal is the time you used to spend just lying in blissfully in bed enjoying every moment is now spent lying torturously in bed hating every minute.  Time passes slower than can be imagined and thinking about how much longer you have to go is often much worse than any symptoms you are actually experiencing.  Along those lines it is important to keep your mind as occupied as possible and once you are able to get out of bed your body as well.Ideas for things to do include: watching movies or TV shows (laughing at a comedy is the best medicine); playing engrossing games (a complex one like chess completely takes over your mind but something intense like poker or the latest shoot-em-up might give some needed release); or anything else that takes your mind off the situation - like coming onto Bluelight.  If you find yourself just too restless to watch TV or play video games, try doing something more complex.  Learning about a subject that interests you for example can hold your attention better than a mindless game and though it seems counter-intuitive to do something harder it often works out.Sitting and staring at the clock is a lot more difficult than just doing something.  If withdrawal doesn't have you stuck to the bathroom floor or physically bedridden then get out of the house, walk to the store, hang out with friends, anything.  It might seem like you aren't up for it, but taking your mind off withdrawal is the key to success.", "date": "23-03-2011", "time": "16:59", "datetime": 1300899540},

{"comment": "Glad to see this thread.  I've had a great deal of personal experience in managing high dose opioid withdrawals, and can help out a bit here.  Understand that I'm not giving medical advice, I'm simply relating my own personal experience.First, we have to have some standard of severity when we discuss withdrawal amelioration.  I propose the following for easy reference:MILD:  Runny nose, sneezing, mild pins and needles in the extremities, anxiety, sweating, diarrhea, restless leg and difficulty sleeping.  These withdrawals typically result from a few weeks of oxy or hydro use, most often in the range of 30 - 80 mg/day.MODERATE:  Includes all of the above, but will involve vomiting and stomach cramps, clammy skin 24/7, more anxiety and anger, extreme horniness (at least in my own experience, its weird I know), and total inability to sleep for 2-3 days solid, usually days 2 through 5.  These type of withdrawals typically result from use of oxy, hydro or similar in the 80 -160mg/day range for at least six months solid.SEVERE:  Includes the above, except that the vomiting is severe and unstoppable, the cramps are debilitating, rendering the subject unable to get out of bed under any circumstances.  Bowel control is usually lost, and it helps to have a someone who can wash the sheets, assuming you have the luxury of withdrawing at home in bed.  The pain in the extremities will be severe, often being compared to being \"burned\" while simultaneously itching terribly.  Very nasty stuff.  These acute aspects vary in duration, depending on the opioids used.  For me, these withdrawals only occurred at doses above 160mg/day for months, more specifically 200-400mg/day, when talking about oxy.LIFE THREATENING:  I know that many people on this forum still believe that opioid withdrawals cannot kill.  That is, unfortunately, one of the most harmful myths still propagated in the medical and correctional fields today.  I have personally witnessed lethal opioid withdrawals, and have experienced one bout of withdrawals of this nature.  The symptomology was inclusive of all the above, except that the vomiting was projectile and dehydrating and intense to the point of forcing me to pass out repeatedly.  Vomiting and diarrhea occur simultaneously in these withdrawals.  In my term, I vomited every few minutes for about forty hours.  I lost 35 pounds in 17 days, and my cellmate died (this occurred in jail.)  Mine were the result of high dose Opana use (160mg/day rectally for several months) directly following 400mg oxy/day for about a year, all without a break.  The life threatening aspect was primarily a result of the inability to keep any liquid down for days and days, resulting in severe electrolyte imbalance and severe dehydration - dehydration being the single most dangerous state a body can be in.Anyway, I realize that withdrawals vary from person to person, but we should at least have some sort of reference for discussion of ways to help.  Mods feel free to clean up the above, or alter it in any helpful way.That being said, I offer my experience with mitigating the beast:The king of non-opioid withdrawal aids must surely be Lyrica (pregabalin).  I found that Lyrica alone, taken in doses of 300-600mg, literally wiped out all of the pain and restless leg issues of moderate to severe oxy withdrawals (160mg/day for a few months, cold turkey).  It was a Godsend for sure, and if you can get it, get it.  It works wonders, believe me.The best OTC combo is without a doubt loperamide/DXM.  Now, you have to be careful with this because these drugs synergize.  Indeed, I use this combo to get a great buzz now and again.  But for withdrawals, assuming you aren't enzyme deficient or taking any drugs that counteract with DXM, you can try taking 60 mg DXM with 24mg loperamide and a glass of white grapefruit juice.  Be sure to take a good senna laxative along with this to avoid constipation issues - but of course you're already managing constipation if you're dealing with opioid withdrawals anyway, aren't you?The idea of using benzos for withdrawals is one that I used to promote, but no longer do.  I've been through benzo withdrawals and they're no joke.  I feel like most folks here will never find themselves in the life threatening category of opioid withdrawals.  Perhaps in that case a dose of xanax could be very useful.  However, the above recommendations really do work for those who find themselves dealing with one of the first three categories I outlined.  Hope this helps!Syn -", "date": "04-05-2011", "time": "20:53", "datetime": 1304542380},

{"comment": "I had been using the new oxycontin OP's and built my tolerance to around a gram of oxy per day. I was takingit orally, but would break the pills into powder and dissolve in Vit. C. I tried to detox w/ subutex, waited a lil over 24 hours since my last oxy OP but still went into precipitated w/d---horrible.  Anyway b/c of the OP's ridiculously long lasting effects (even when I thought I was in mild w/d I wasn't) I decided to switch to heroin and taper with that drug. I've found that switching to a shorter acting opiate has helped me gauge how much I need, as I feel very mild w/d symptoms anywhere from 5-10 hours after my last dose.  BUT I have a question:I know sleepiness (at least for me) is the first w/d symptom I experience.  About 4 hours after my dose I become very sleepy, and my body just wants to sleep until I can re-dose.  Here's the thing, Heroin itself makes me sleepy, MUCH more so than oxy, oxy made me energetic while high.

{"comment": "^agreed, although I'm not talking about REAL w/d. To be more accurate, I'm referring to that period of minutes---hours; from the tail end of the high from your last dose until the moment right before you re-dose.  I find (IME) that this phenomenon is much more pronounced when one has no opiates left and is playing that insufferable game of waiting for your supplier----that game where 5 minutes becomes 30, which leads to calls going to voicemail, until a few hours after the supposed meeting time you finally resupply.  In that scenario, its likely psychological as you know its gonna be longer than you were told so sleeping is the easiest way to pass time.  But nonetheless, even with a full supply, b/c I'm tappering down,  I wait to re-dose for as long as possible. I don't wait till I'm sick or even in the mildest of w/d, I wait until the buzz has completely gone and I am just tired.

No matter what you do to help ease your way through withdrawal, the only real way to get better is over time.  During this time, since we can't directly treat the cause of the withdrawal by taking more opiates (or we only partially treat them if tapering), we treat the symptoms of opiate withdrawal.Supportive treatment is a term in medicine where if you can't treat the cause of a disease to cure it, you manage the symptoms as best you can.First and foremost (much like surviving on a desert island) we take care of our basic bodily needs.There are many drugs which are often available over the counter (without a prescription) that can do wonders for helping alleviate certain symptoms of opioid withdrawal.  Some of the more commonly used ones are listed here.Although the OTC drugs listed above do help with some symptoms, there are more potent prescription drugs which would be considered preferable; if you can get your hands on them.  The most notable of these are benzodiazepines which, depending on the specific one, can be a combination of a sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant.  Benzos are often prescribed by detox clinics and are definitely a good thing to have.Some others include:It is debatable whether substances like weed, booze, coke, ketamine, etc. should be taken during opiate withdrawal.  They have the potential to make the situation much worse, however they can help both with physical symptoms and with taking your mind off of withdrawal.  It basically comes down to a personal choice but anything that is hard on the body or has a hard comedown is probably not going to help anything (eg. stims and booze).  Smoking weed is probably the most common and can definitely help people relax and take their mind off the withdrawal but it does elevate your heart rate and can make anxiety worse.Endorphines are natural opioids created by your body in response to certain situations.  They are what is needed to get you feeling better again and there are several ways you can trigger their release.One of the worst things about withdrawal is the time you used to spend just lying in blissfully in bed enjoying every moment is now spent lying torturously in bed hating every minute.  Time passes slower than can be imagined and thinking about how much longer you have to go is often much worse than any symptoms you are actually experiencing.  Along those lines it is important to keep your mind as occupied as possible and once you are able to get out of bed your body as well.Ideas for things to do include: watching movies or TV shows (laughing at a comedy is the best medicine); playing engrossing games (a complex one like chess completely takes over your mind but something intense like poker or the latest shoot-em-up might give some needed release); or anything else that takes your mind off the situation - like coming onto Bluelight.  If you find yourself just too restless to watch TV or play video games, try doing something more complex.  Learning about a subject that interests you for example can hold your attention better than a mindless game and though it seems counter-intuitive to do something harder it often works out.Sitting and staring at the clock is a lot more difficult than just doing something.  If withdrawal doesn't have you stuck to the bathroom floor or physically bedridden then get out of the house, walk to the store, hang out with friends, anything.  It might seem like you aren't up for it, but taking your mind off withdrawal is the key to success.", "date": "23-03-2011", "time": "16:59", "datetime": 1300899540},

{"comment": "Glad to see this thread.  I've had a great deal of personal experience in managing high dose opioid withdrawals, and can help out a bit here.  Understand that I'm not giving medical advice, I'm simply relating my own personal experience.First, we have to have some standard of severity when we discuss withdrawal amelioration.  I propose the following for easy reference:MILD:  Runny nose, sneezing, mild pins and needles in the extremities, anxiety, sweating, diarrhea, restless leg and difficulty sleeping.  These withdrawals typically result from a few weeks of oxy or hydro use, most often in the range of 30 - 80 mg/day.MODERATE:  Includes all of the above, but will involve vomiting and stomach cramps, clammy skin 24/7, more anxiety and anger, extreme horniness (at least in my own experience, its weird I know), and total inability to sleep for 2-3 days solid, usually days 2 through 5.  These type of withdrawals typically result from use of oxy, hydro or similar in the 80 -160mg/day range for at least six months solid.SEVERE:  Includes the above, except that the vomiting is severe and unstoppable, the cramps are debilitating, rendering the subject unable to get out of bed under any circumstances.  Bowel control is usually lost, and it helps to have a someone who can wash the sheets, assuming you have the luxury of withdrawing at home in bed.  The pain in the extremities will be severe, often being compared to being \"burned\" while simultaneously itching terribly.  Very nasty stuff.  These acute aspects vary in duration, depending on the opioids used.  For me, these withdrawals only occurred at doses above 160mg/day for months, more specifically 200-400mg/day, when talking about oxy.LIFE THREATENING:  I know that many people on this forum still believe that opioid withdrawals cannot kill.  That is, unfortunately, one of the most harmful myths still propagated in the medical and correctional fields today.  I have personally witnessed lethal opioid withdrawals, and have experienced one bout of withdrawals of this nature.  The symptomology was inclusive of all the above, except that the vomiting was projectile and dehydrating and intense to the point of forcing me to pass out repeatedly.  Vomiting and diarrhea occur simultaneously in these withdrawals.  In my term, I vomited every few minutes for about forty hours.  I lost 35 pounds in 17 days, and my cellmate died (this occurred in jail.)  Mine were the result of high dose Opana use (160mg/day rectally for several months) directly following 400mg oxy/day for about a year, all without a break.  The life threatening aspect was primarily a result of the inability to keep any liquid down for days and days, resulting in severe electrolyte imbalance and severe dehydration - dehydration being the single most dangerous state a body can be in.Anyway, I realize that withdrawals vary from person to person, but we should at least have some sort of reference for discussion of ways to help.  Mods feel free to clean up the above, or alter it in any helpful way.That being said, I offer my experience with mitigating the beast:The king of non-opioid withdrawal aids must surely be Lyrica (pregabalin).  I found that Lyrica alone, taken in doses of 300-600mg, literally wiped out all of the pain and restless leg issues of moderate to severe oxy withdrawals (160mg/day for a few months, cold turkey).  It was a Godsend for sure, and if you can get it, get it.  It works wonders, believe me.The best OTC combo is without a doubt loperamide/DXM.  Now, you have to be careful with this because these drugs synergize.  Indeed, I use this combo to get a great buzz now and again.  But for withdrawals, assuming you aren't enzyme deficient or taking any drugs that counteract with DXM, you can try taking 60 mg DXM with 24mg loperamide and a glass of white grapefruit juice.  Be sure to take a good senna laxative along with this to avoid constipation issues - but of course you're already managing constipation if you're dealing with opioid withdrawals anyway, aren't you?The idea of using benzos for withdrawals is one that I used to promote, but no longer do.  I've been through benzo withdrawals and they're no joke.  I feel like most folks here will never find themselves in the life threatening category of opioid withdrawals.  Perhaps in that case a dose of xanax could be very useful.  However, the above recommendations really do work for those who find themselves dealing with one of the first three categories I outlined.  Hope this helps!Syn -", "date": "04-05-2011", "time": "20:53", "datetime": 1304542380},

{"comment": "I had been using the new oxycontin OP's and built my tolerance to around a gram of oxy per day. I was takingit orally, but would break the pills into powder and dissolve in Vit. C. I tried to detox w/ subutex, waited a lil over 24 hours since my last oxy OP but still went into precipitated w/d---horrible.  Anyway b/c of the OP's ridiculously long lasting effects (even when I thought I was in mild w/d I wasn't) I decided to switch to heroin and taper with that drug. I've found that switching to a shorter acting opiate has helped me gauge how much I need, as I feel very mild w/d symptoms anywhere from 5-10 hours after my last dose.  BUT I have a question:I know sleepiness (at least for me) is the first w/d symptom I experience.  About 4 hours after my dose I become very sleepy, and my body just wants to sleep until I can re-dose.  Here's the thing, Heroin itself makes me sleepy, MUCH more so than oxy, oxy made me energetic while high.  And since I'm using the H to taper, I can't tell if these bouts of sleepiness I get during the day are b/c I'm high from the H or b/c I'm starting to w/d from the H.

{"comment": "^agreed, although I'm not talking about REAL w/d. To be more accurate, I'm referring to that period of minutes---hours; from the tail end of the high from your last dose until the moment right before you re-dose.  I find (IME) that this phenomenon is much more pronounced when one has no opiates left and is playing that insufferable game of waiting for your supplier----that game where 5 minutes becomes 30, which leads to calls going to voicemail, until a few hours after the supposed meeting time you finally resupply.  In that scenario, its likely psychological as you know its gonna be longer than you were told so sleeping is the easiest way to pass time.  But nonetheless, even with a full supply, b/c I'm tappering down,  I wait to re-dose for as long as possible. I don't wait till I'm sick or even in the mildest of w/d, I wait until the buzz has completely gone and I am just tired.  BUT, as stated b4, since I'm using heroin now, I'm tired even when I AM high, making identification of when a re-dose is needed more difficult", "date": "05-05-2011", "time": "19:26", "datetime": 1304623560},

Heroin taken orally is only a fraction of the strength of it injected IV so it won't be that intense either.

But you're in WDs and probably don't want to spend time looking shit up, you'd rather just feel better, so I'll bite...here's what has worked for me:Dextromethorphan - the Robo cough gels work pretty well. 30-60 mg, not even enough to trip off of, can get rid of some of the aches n' pains.Loperamide (Imodium) - Keeps you from shitting, and for some people helps with many more symptoms. It's an opiate that doesnt cross the ol' triple B, so that makes sense.Ramen - You gotta eat something, and you dont want to eat, so ramen is something that's pretty easy to get down and keep downDiphenhydramine (Benadryl, Dramamine, etc.) - It'll help you sleep. I guess you have benzos, too, but antihistamines work better for some people.5-HTP - This serotonin precursor should help with your depression, although it could make you more lethargic, tooPersonally I wouldn't take the vitamins cuz they make me nauseous, but if they're working for you then keep at it. Also I find that having a few drinks helps if you have to socialize (in an environment where it's okay to drink), and could help you sleep, but most people think that the resulting hangover isn't worth it, YMMV.And you're doing the right thing avoiding the subs.

I decided to get myself unaddicted so I've substituted the DHC with plain codeine and started taking a daily dose thats about 5X less than what I was taking before. At first I just took 300mg of codeine 24 hours after my last dose of DHC but fairly harsh withdrawal symptoms kicked in so I upped my codeine a dose of 600mg every 24 hours. This gets rid of withdrawal symptoms completely but I'm wondering what kinda progress I'm making if any.

{"comment": "If you are taking enough codeine to eliminate all of your withdrawal symptoms and it is making you feel about the same as you would with your regular dose of DHC then you are probably not making much progress.  However since Codeine is a little bit weaker than DHC and has a ceiling dose based on how much your liver can metabolize into Morphine you may be making a tiny bit of progress.If you are thinking that switching from codeine to DHC eliminates you addiction or dependence you are incorrect.All you are doing is substituting one addiction for another.  Both Codeine and DHC are opiates so unless you are planning on tapering with the codeine you might as well go back to your DHC and at least enjoy you high a little more.Now if you are serious about getting off of opiates completely or at lease lowering your dose then you should just set up a taper schedule and slowly step down using the codeine.If you are taking 600mg of codeine a day then start cutting that by 50mg every 3 or 4 days tell you get to nothing.  You can also do this with the DHC, and in fact I think DHC actually has a longer half life so it could be better for tapering.  I know they make DHC continuous that would keep the levels of drug in your body level through out the day making the taper much smother.GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "date": "13-06-2011", "time": "16:41", "datetime": 1307983260},

{"comment": "I'm hoping that the large increase in timing between doses (going from dosing every 3 hours to every 24 hours) will contribute something though. Right now I'm toughing out an hour or 2 of withdrawal symptoms per day and gradually increasing the time between doses. For example say yesterday I waited 24 hours to take my daily 600mg of codeine, today I'll wait 25 hours. Toughing out an hour or two of withdrawal per day is dead easy because you know that when you finally do redose you'll go from feeling like shit to feeling good.Gradually tapering down my dosage of DHC looks like a good approach though I might just do that instead. The dose spacing approach makes a lot of sense though. If you add say an hour each day (or every few days depending on how long it takes for receptors to reform) to the space between your doses then you will be forcing yourself to endure a limited time period of withdrawal but it is not all that bad because you know you only have to endure it for an hour or so. This may be tricky to synchronise if you have to get up at the same time each morning because your dose time will eventually go past your bed time so when that happens you'll probably be forced to switch to the dosage tapering approach.Anyhow thanks for merging my post with this thread.

I'm running low on money at the moment so its looking like a run in with the cold turkey is in the pipeline. As crazy as it sounds, amphetamines definitely mask withdrawal symptoms. I took 30mg of dextroamphetamine earlier and its starting to kick in and I feel my w/d symptoms fading by the minute. I've experienced this plenty of times before.

The withdrawal shouldn't be too bad, you body may just need to adjust to the lower dose.I would suggest looking taking additional things to potentiate opiates.is a link to a thread on that found in the Other Drugs forum.  The first post in that thread has a link to the 1st version of it as well.  Reading through those is a great start.As far as easing withdrawals symptoms, the two easily obtainable (OTC) meds that you should look into are immodium (loperamide), and diphenhydramine (benadryl) which is also used for potentiation.  The immodium will help with preventing diarrhea, among other things,  and the diphenhydramine can help you sleep at night.

The most I have taken is 2 of them(ie 6mg) in a dose, one dose per night. I get a nice calm feeling but no sleep.Can I take a larger dose? Is a larger dose likely to help any more than what I am already taking? Can I redose throughtout the night if needed and how often?Also I have been getting plenty of excercise already with 8 hrs physical labor at my job so it's not like I'm laying around all day.Thanks for any help.", "date": "08-08-2011", "time": "18:16", "datetime": 1312827360},
{"comment": "I ended up taking 9mg melatonin(three 3mg pills), 2 Valerian extract pills(sorry don't know the mg) and a cup of Chamomile tea. Felt very drowsy but didn't sleep. Eventually I took 8mg Loperamide late at night and a couple hours later I slept. The sleep felt like a true deep sleep but I did wake up and fall back to sleep several times. I feel the Loperamide had alot do do with the sleep because up until then I had been trying various things over the last many days/nights like Diphenhydramine, DXM, wine, heavy meals and the afforemention natural sleep aids, all with very little success.My biggest question now is will I go back into withdrawls when the Loperamide wears off?

I did have one night of somewhat decent sleep(about 5 hours) during the 11 or so days before resorting to Lope but the other days ranged from 0 hrs to 2 hrs sleep per night.I would be interested to hear how long and how bad other people's insomnia was and whether it gradually ended or if it just broke eventually to where one day they could suddenly sleep normally.", "date": "10-08-2011", "time": "05:18", "datetime": 1312953480},

I am attributing this to the fact that I had tapered this time and didn't go cold turkey. I can already sleep 8+ hours straight and only finished the taper 14 days ago. Other times quitting cold turkey I did notice my sleep was messed up for quit a while. And from other posts I have read that insomnia is commonly one of the last physical symptoms to disappear. It gets better over time, I would guess in a couple weeks you will be sleeping relatively normally again.

{"comment": "It's basically cold turkey. Save diazepam and oxazepam for anxiety during the day and use lorazepam as a sleep aid. 3 0.5mg tablets is a very small dose so pray you've got enough diazepam and oxazepam to stop thoughts that cause you to think it's worse than it is in reality. You should be physically alright after 10-14 days but then you will still feel physical weakness and have depressive episode for a few weeks to a few months. It's a personal thing.To make it less severe you would need a drug like clonidine, it helps fight racing heart and anxiety. But then it should be used with caution as it lowers blood pressure and if you overdo it then you jump from one physical addiction to another. If clonidine is used, then after the withdrawal ends it's usually tapered down. Also, you'd be better having some typical hypnotic benzos, lorazepam is prescribed for insomnia but it never made me sleepy, I hope it helps you but like I said 1.5mg is a small dose so it will play a minor role. Maybe some weak neuroleptics like levomepromazine would be good to help you at night to fall asleep but then again they aren't good for restless legs.And one more thing. Make the fact you go through it with your girlfriend an advantage. If she goes nuts, don't you go nuts as well and even make it worse. Calm her down and see it as a better option to withdraw with a close person. Don't give yourselves a mindfuck. Withdrawal is actually mostly in your head so it depends what your attitude is before the start of withdrawal. This is a crucial thing and it may make the W/D much less severe but it may also make it one big hell on Earth.Good luck!", "date": "13-08-2011", "time": "04:13", "datetime": 1313208780},

{"comment": "Hey everyone! This is a great thread! I'm starting my last semester of college and I really can't afford to screw it up. I've managed to balance a heroin addiction and a college education at a prestiguous university but I have my hardest classes to take this year and I need to start looking for a job/internship. I think it's time to quit for a while- I can't afford to do it daily like I have been as it takes up a TON of cash and time as you all know. I've been on and off opiates, primarly heroin, for about 3 years. I was clean for the majority of the summer of 2010 and started IV'ing again once school started in August. I was only doing about .1-.2g a day at first but now several months later I'm up to doing .3 to .5g daily. Somedays even 1.0. The dope I get is pretty potent; I'd rate it around 7/10.What I'd like to know:How long does it take to get through the worst part of withdrawals? I.E. When will I stop having hot/cold flashes, leg cramps, etc.?What OTC medicines/herbs/vitamines/etc. can help ease withdrawals? (Can I get a list please? I know Immodium and Dxm help)Should I go to the hospital/doctors office to try to get prescribed something to help? If so, what would you recommend I say? (I really don't want to tell them the truth as I had cancer when I was younger and have been in remission 20+ years but nonetheless my health insurance is expensive and will be even more expensive if the company knows I'm opiate dependent. If I'm out of options I guess I'll have to tell them though.)After how many days do you think I'll finally be able to sleep, even if only for a few hours? (I know that during the first night, and probably the second, sleep will be out of the question.)What prescriptions meds or even street drugs may help with withdrawals? ( can't smoke pot b/c I have an upcoming drug test but perhaps JWH is an option? Or something else?)Any other advice????Also, I know benzodiazepines may help immensely, however they aren't available in my area (Cincinnati) at the moment.Thank you so much for your help.

Are you getting both top and bottom pulled out? The bottom ones hurt a lot more than the top. I got kind of screwed over because originally I went to the dentist, who told me that yes I do need to get my wisdom teeth pulled and so he pulled my top ones... and Im like wtf? why are my bottom ones still there? So he tells, well I'm a dentist, you have to go to an oral surgeon to get the bottom ones pulled out... grrrrr... so be careful of that - don't go through two surgeries and twice the pain if you don't have to.They put me under nitrous for the top ones and put me competely under for the bottom ones. Before they put me under for the bottom ones I got a shot of fentanyl and versed which felt pretty damn good.As far as going through WD's and then a week later having your wisdom teeth pulled, you'll body will not have opiates in it anymore prior to having your teeth removed as opiates typically leave the body in as quickly as 2-3 days. So while you don't have opiates in your system, you may be more sensitive to the pain. However, they'll give you medicine to help with the pain. They'll most likely give you vicodin or percocet. I got vicodin 7.5's but most people from what I've heard of get Perc 5's. If you take them as prescribed, either medicine, you shouldn't feel much wd symptoms after you stop - especially if you taper down. I had pain for about two weeks but that's because I kept smoking and it formed a dry socket. THESE ARE REALLY PAINFUL! DON'T SMOKE!! YOU'LL REGRET IT LIKE I DID! During this time I was taking both the vicodin I was prescribed (which didn't do much) and heroin, because well I've been doing heroin quite a long time but now am ready to quit for a while and go through wd's as my current situation pretty much requires it.Hope I could be of help, if you need more info PM me or msg me on AIM - my screen name is trancespottingpl", "date": "25-08-2011", "time": "03:10", "datetime": 1314241800},
{"comment": "What happens when one is withdrawing from a particular opiate, then uses a different opiate (assuming equi-potent doses) to relieve withdrawal and even get a little high too. Would this SWITCH the opiate from which you are withdrawing to the most recent one?For example, on Monday I snort 10mg of Opana, 3 times within 12 hours (total of 30mg). On Thursday, when I am in fullwithdrawal I plug oxycodone 30mg (~equal to 10mg Opana), 3 times within 12 hours (total of 90mg).In this scenario, on Sunday when I am feeling shitty, am I withdrawing from Oxycodone or Opana?Does it change to the most recently-used opiate (OC), or does it then become a combination of OC and OM (b/c OM's long WD would make it overlap into the OC withdrawal time-wise)?

{"comment": "Just sharing my current experience.I've been taking an assortment of 5-325 Percocet, 5-500 Vicodin, 4 mg Dilaudid and the occasional 40 mg OP Oxy for about a month now, always at prescribed dosages only and rarely in combination. Different day, different pill. And although I have enough drugs to last me the entire year, I decided to see what the withdrawal would be like if I went one whole day without any of it (cos I'm curious and weird like that).It's been a day and I've been.Most of you know the feeling, of course, but yeah it's what I'd imagine if my boyfriend ever told me he hated me and while I had the flu. I'm still functional but hurt all over and am rather irate. If it's this bad having only indulged in low-dose opioids for a month, I cannot and do not wish to imagine what it's like for real junkies of any sort of opiate. I popped a Perc about an hour ago and already feel better; that weird burning in my sternum area is slowly dissipating. So my plan is to start weaning myself off over a two- to three-month period. I also have some methadone, which should help. Looking at the post above ^ I'll give Lyrica and Xanax a try too. And weed. Lots of weed.I could push through my withdrawal now and quit the pill-popping ... but that'd a huge waste of my cabinet.", "date": "16-03-2012", "time": "03:53", "datetime": 1331869980},
{"comment": "I'm currently on my first day kicking Suboxone, which I tried to taper down to 1mg a day but was half sick during the whole attempted taper. (I usually take 8mgs.) I've been addicted to H for 2 yrs and taking Subs on and off for a year, using them to supplement my heroin addiction. Well, I figured kicking subs couldn't be nearly as bad as withdrawing from heroin but I fucking wanted to blow my brains out all day.So I went to the drug store and bought several medications. I took 24mgs Loperamide and 3 \"Hyland's Restless Legs\" tablets, 5 Neurontin AKA Gabapentin, which is used to treat nerve pain, seizures and RLS (my Dr gave it to me for anxiety) and Naproxen. I now feel amazing. But I've been having hallucinations and I feel like I'm on speed, my boyfriend wants to kill me cause I've been talking really fast and acting crazy. However, I'd highly recommend the restless legs tablets because the worst symptom for me is the constant need to change position, uselessly tossing and turning. Gabapentin is effective too but it's not as accessible since it's not OTC.But aside from medications, the most effective way to deal with junk sickness is meditation. It brings tremendous physical release, and it's just about the only thing I did when going through severe heroin withdrawal. I'd meditate for hours. Astral projection is the best relief there is, escaping the body. If you don't believe me, that's cool. No need to argue about that shit. But if you're interested, there's a lot of info out there about these techniques. And in my experience, the heightened awareness of junk sickness lends itself to astral projection.Any one else think early w/d can be compared to the come down from acid? I'm talking about the enhanced sensory and mental aspects, you know, like Burroughs said, it brings back the magic of childhood. And the tension and muscle aches.

{"comment": "Originally Posted by rwmartinI'll preface this post by saying I'm partly ashamed and embarrassed that I've gotten myself into this place of panicking about either going into serious withdrawals or having some kind of panic attack - which I got myself into because of carelessness - now that I've said this I'll post my question.I've been taking (via snorting) 40 mg Opana ER over the past month - usually using 4 - 5 pills per day. I'm going to come to the end of my Rx and for some reason today I'm feeling a little sick and I'm hoping someone with good experience and knowledge will read this and provide me with advice as soon as possible.It's 5pm here in NY and I've snorted two pills so far today. I'm feeling slightly like I'm going into withdrawals - like tingling down my upper spine, a bit groggy, generally out-of-it, but no other apparent usual withdrawal symptoms. I have been pretty much inactive for the past few days and today after sitting around maybe thinking and obsessing too much about how I could run out before I will be able to get more of this Rx, I made myself go for a walk because it felt like I was going to have a panic attack - which I have never had before so not sure what is going on.Now I only have 20 pills left (with a possibility of getting a new Rx of 10 mg Opana ER if the pharma fills this - not sure since this Rx I'm on won't be refillable till 7/15). If I'm unable to get that new Rx filled which will definitely help me not go into withdrawals - can someone tell me what I can do to ease this panicky feeling I'm having now? And what dosage should I take of the remaining 20 pills of the 40 mg Opana ER to keep me going till 7/15 (which is 12 days away) or if I want to taper down and stop completely? Any constructive/productive help here would be greatly appreciated.Sorry for the long post - wanted to be thorough and complete. Lastly - I take Mirtazapine 45 mg (Remeron) once per day as an anti depressant - in case you know of any indications there.Please letmeknow how the detox went after being on opana. That is what I am on plus 15mg. oxy 4X day. I'm afraid to detox but I need to for a job. I usedto snort my opanas but now the new formula sucks so I am trying different methods.

I had everything from runny nose, vomiting and horrible diarrhea. My legs hurt so bad I couldn't even move. I was getting cold sweats and bad anxiety. I actually went to the emergency room and was precribed clonidine and xanax which helped soooooo much. Clonidine is a god send. I also took immodium which helped w the diarrhea.

{"comment": "I have been a long time lurker and have gained lots of knowledge here. It's time for me to give back some.So the short version of my story. I have been using opiates for the past two years daily besides those dreaded times I had to wait to get paid or wait for them to come in. Of course when I first started using my tolerance was a lot less than it was this past year. Over this past year I was using 250-300 mg of oxy/roxi daily, sniffed, or whatever other pill opiates I could get my hands on. I knew it was time for me to take a break however the wd were physically too much. The mental aspect has never really been an issue for the most part.I used a short term methadone detox. This is what I did. I got 11, 10mg methadone.The first morning I had half an 80 op to keep the wd at bay until I could got get the methadone.Day 1. 8pm 20mgDay 2. 8am 20mg, 8pm 10mgDay 3. 8am 20mg, 8pm 5mgDay 4. 8am 15mg, 8pm 5mgDay 5. 8am 15mgI took 50mg of trazadone every night to make sure I slept. I knew I had to sleep so my body could rest, and recuperate.I also started taking a multi vitamin, one in the morning and one at night. I drank lots of Gatorade also. I ate what I could but my appetite wasn't that much at first.I of course had some minor wd symptoms but could still work, be a husband, and be a dad. I was a bit worried still once I stopped the methadone but nothing happened besides not sleeping as well.I thought this went very well for me. Plus my bank account and wife are a lot happier now too.Hopefully this helps someone. I'm just a regular guy that enjoys getting high.

{"comment": "There are many drugs which are often available over the counter (without a prescription) that can do wonders for helping alleviate certain symptoms of opioid withdrawal.  Some of the more commonly used ones are listed here.Although the OTC drugs listed above do help with some symptoms, there are more potent prescription drugs which would be considered preferable; if you can get your hands on them.  The most notable of these are benzodiazepines which, depending on the specific one, can be a combination of a sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant.  Benzos are often prescribed by detox clinics and are definitely a good thing to have.Some others include:Just wanted to say I can agree to most of this. But i wanted to add that Loperamide Hcl is does in fact pass the blood brain barrier, it just gets pushed out just as quickly. Now before i say this I can say i have honestly done this. After being clean for over a year I took a 9mm luger to the foot. It went right through. I tryed to walk in the house and pull it out not knowing it was in the ground. Whoops. Anyway me being me took the 4x10mg oxys a day while i was layed up. When i went back I said start weening me off and they helped. BUT. When I used to get high and i was pretty low on funds. for 9 bucks at wallmart you can get 148 2mg loperamide pills. Personally I would take 80 pills the first day. NOTE: you cannot take this kind of ammount every day, it last for two days, trust me. You will not need it. than go down to 60 pills 24 hours from the first dose. than 40, 20, 10. I'll also add that If you can get ahold of some Adderoll stayin a little tweaked will keep you busy and some benzo's.. Especially valium since its a very nice muscle relaxer as well. Now your thinking so im not going to shit for 2 weeks? no you sure will. unless your tweaked out prob not but oh well. You could even save the speed for after the loperamide hcl. Anyway this is how I've done it in the past. Benzo's are pretty easy to get prescribed and adderoll i get for college so im sure thats pretty easy to get a scrip for as well.  Just drink lots of water, if your not tweeking eat. the loperamide will completely take your sickness away at that dose. Personally I've taken 120 pills at one time. Its not all that but youll be scratching your nose and feeling fine on those 80 pills. Just dont keep taking them. Or your then addicted to them.

{"comment": "I used methadone from March 2010 until 2 weeks ago. I can't cope with the withdrawal. I am also addicted and tolerant to benzodiazepines, I had been prescribed 4mg clonazepam / day for some time before all this happened. If it's too much reading (I know it is), just skip it and go to questions in bold.I tapered down but my schedule definitely wasn't perfect. I needed split-dosing because methadone held me for ~16 hours only. I tapered down a bit too fast and spontaneously, one reason for this was doses like 6mg - 4mg didn't help me any more so I rushed (why put more of it if it doesn't help any more?). I will list a few recent weeks to show you how I did it wrong and how I possibly caused myself hell of a withdrawal:As you see above less than 2 weeks before I tapered off I took 2 \"big\" doses 2 days in a row, I guess this was the problem. The other mistake is I tapered too fast later. I've got just one week before I have to get back to my university, that's why I wanted it fast, also I jumped off it just like that because I started feeling sick on.I didn't go to a psychiatrist until the 7th day of being off. He prescribed me mianserin (30mg before going to bed for 6 days, I should take 30mg in the morning today as he wanted me to go for 60mg / d eventually) and ketoprofen. Mianserin just made me a bit sleepy for like 3 days, that's all, and aches from methadone withdrawal are so strong that ketoprofen doesn't help a bit (it did help in the past when I was off morphine or heroin cold turkey). It was so bad that I called the hospital to find the doctor and he told me not to increase clonazepam from 4mg to 6mg. Well, it's no difference to me, e.g. today I haven't taken clonazepam at all, my addiction lasts 8 years so I don't feel any high from e.g. 20mg, it doesn't make me sleepy or amnesic. It's obvious but I mention it because the increase in daily dose was supposed to be simply psychological.Yesterday I had a second visit (14th day of being off). Problems? Elevated blood pressure (120/80, my normal BP is 100/70, low), feeling of my heart sky-rocketing (only 72 BPM while lying in bed), terrible sweating (I've never had such a problem with this kicking morphine or heroin cold turkey - 10 days and I could go out; now I have to change my T-shirt every 30 seconds so I wear nothing), feeling cold (no hot or cold flashes, it's a constant feeling), goose bumps, shivers, diarrhoea, insomnia (I sleep 4 hours a day at most and it's usually 2 hours at night and 2 hours on the afternoons from exhaustion), and of course terrible mind-fuck (embarrassing memories from the past, inability to think about the bright future without opioids, I can only think about things connected with my previous lifestyle), panic attacks, anxiety...I asked the psychiatrist if there is any medication that could decrease sweating and help with my heart (sweating and feeling cold are actually 2 symptoms that I can't take any more, that's why I took 450mg of codeine to chill...), he replied \"no\". Nonetheless, I told him \"well, I won't pretend that I'm as green as grass in this field, I know clonidine is used to help withdrawal symptoms\". He said that clonidine is an old drug and nowadays when we have methadone or tramadol, such drugs are very rarely used, besides it could cause bradycardia easily in my case. He asked me if I still have some methadone - he wanted to suggest going back on a low dose if it's so severe - I replied \"yes, but I don't want to touch it seeing how I'm freaking now because of it\".I know it's all typical for opioid withdrawal. Yesterday I seemed \"happy\" when leaving and definitely I was better mentally. But last night was terrible, I woke up at 2 AM and couldn't sleep any more. I was very anxious and nervous. I can't stand being alone all day and that night upset me even more. I just see my mum for like 8 hours. I don't have anyone to open my mouth to and I'm freaking out, minutes are like hours, hours are like weeks, weeks are like months... And I did it, I injected 450mg of codeine intramuscularly at 1 PM, it helped for sweating, I even felt it in in my head but my hands were still cold. Anyway, 1 PM means I don't have much time before withdrawal starts again and I guess I will move back in time. - the question is by how much I extended the withdrawal?1) By how much could I extend duration of withdrawal?2) Is it normal that withdrawal from methadone lasts 2-3 weeks (physical part of it) even if one decreases doses? (I know I didn't do it right but I didn't quit cold turkey from e.g. 30mg, right?) I guess the key part here is that I ingested methadone for 2.5 years.3) It's clear that I can't cope with anxiety and sweating, that means even these 2 things alone will drive me crazy. The psychiatrist said that the withdrawal from methadone can last up to 3 weeks and physical symptoms like feeling cold and sweating will stay for much much longer. This means sooner or later I will take again like a idiot, just what I've done today with codeine.4) I've been addicted to opioids for 8 years. Is it still possible I can live without substitution? The doctor didn't suggest anything, even temporarily so I can study. And it's clear that even if I hadn't taken codeine today, I wouldn't be in a good shape in a week (on the 25th day of being off methadone).5) Should I ask for Suboxone? Taking it would guarantee I wouldn't take any opioid agonists, also, buprenorphine never gave me foggy thoughts, to be honest I was more active, more sociable, and less depressed (I don't know if it's mianserin or not, but now I even think about getting morphine and going for the last hit...). Anyway, getting on Suboxone is time-consuming (just like methadone). First, a week on the detox ward to get me on the right dose, and then I would have to collect it every day for like 2-3 months (the act on substitution states that one can't get a 1-week supply right after entering the program).Should I ask for tramadol taper-down? If he agrees, let him prepare the schedule so nothing goes wrong this time?Also, there's an extended release medication with dihydrocodeine here but Polish law doesn't state that this medication (or dihydrocodeine itself) can be used for detox / taper-down (it doesn't state that tramadol may be used for detox / taper-down but I know this doctor uses it for taper-downs outside the detox ward, he once prescribed me tramadol starting with 100-100-100-100 but then I had a 200mg morphine / 40mg levorphanol problem so it was useless, now it would seem all right if 450mg of codeine brought me relief for 4-5 hours (I guess, I'm starting to feel cold).I used Cannabis (Indica) twice a day (once during the day and once at night, otherwise I couldn't fall asleep even with mianserin). Mianserin should be a great drug for opioid withdrawal looking at its action in CNS but it doesn't do much + gives me suicidal thoughts... Antagonism/inverse agonism on some 5-HT receptors could help with the thoughts and eating problems but it doesn't, I feel anorectic and nauseous when I put any kind of food into my mouth, acting on alpha-adrenergic receptors should be calming but it's too weak there. I stopped using Cannabis as I thought there could be rebound effects from smoking twice a day like more perspiration and anxiety (only Cannabis helps me for sweating, it just stops it by reducing anxiety totally). Now I know if I smoked in the morning, I wouldn't inject codeine. It helped me the same way on the 11th day of being off methadone, I calmed down and decided that it would be stupid to take any opioid if I survived 11 days.Thanks in advance for any reply, this withdrawal is a shock for me and every option seems bad except waiting for the end of it which I'm not capable of (I didn't think much, there was just a thought and there was a codeine shot).", "date": "21-09-2012", "time": "17:14", "datetime": 1348247640},

I don't think adding to it is healthy and helping mentally or physically in any way. I always tried to calm my body.

{"comment": "I've been a chronic pain patient for more than a decade, and have been on moderately high dose morphine since 2004, and some type of around the clock opiate/opioid since 2001.  I was at 180mg a day in 2005-2011, which has since been cut to a prescribed 90mg a day plus other pain meds so rougly 120mg morphine a day. I went on an experimental treatment for the underlying disease, and over about 5 years it made some fairly substantial improvements in the disease itself. I'm not completely cured, though it did cure one of the problems as far as I can tell; the other problem is substantially less. I went from being suicidal from the pain even with the 180mg of morphine to where I could get by with 45mg a day and just be okay most of the time, but still a pain flare here and there that needed more. The underlying problem has improved beyond that, its just not completely gone.Unfortunately, I discovered that since I was no longer having to take 180mg a day even though I could get by with 45mg or 60mg a day and be comfortable... Well, you can guess how that goes. I started taking more to cope with just the general unhappiness of the things the disease cost me. Never a good idea to drown your sorrows in substances, but I did it anyway. I had huge reserves saved up, and well, you can guess how that went...  At first it was just averaging about 100mg a day, and then suddenly it was 2-3x that to get high, and some days beyond that. I probably can manage the pain symptoms I have on lyrica, naproxen, tylenol sometimes, and the occasional dose of oxycodone/hydrocodone for flares. I'm going to ask my doc on the 22nd to write me the lyrica and see how it goes, but I can't get in before then.I've managed to taper down to 30mg a day with Ms contin from around 120mg a day over a month and a half, but that still leaves several hours a day that are uncomfortable. On the 3rd or so I'll get 50 tablets of oxycodone 5mg and it probably will be a lot easier to taper off with that.  I need to do this fairly quickly as the semester starts on the 14th. That gives me roughly 10 days to do what I need to do at the absolute max, and I would like to do it a little faster than that in case my pain levels are still high after the taper (I know they will be during).I. The morphine is just clouding my head, and I can't get through school and have my head fuzzy anymore. Undergrad stuff was one thing, but I'm in graduate school now, and I can't screw this up, you know?I know if I have it around I'll be tempted to use it. At the same time, I'm terrified of going to my pain doc for help in case I don't get off or find that I am forced to still take some type of opioid intermittently for pain (which is likely to be the case). I know the guys personality enough to know that if I come clean with him, he wont be writing out my pain meds anymore if I find I have to change it around to even something far lesser for pain.Here is what I have to work with, and I could definitely use some advice on how best to employ it from someone who has a. I do NOT expect this to be incredibly comfortable, but I have to be able to sleep during. I tried going cold turkey during winter break, and I could deal with pain, the nausea, the diarrhea (immodium helped, but did not stop it for me),. I lasted 3 days, and had to take something just to get it to stop. That led me back to 30mg a day just to keep symptoms at bay. I'm naive on this stuff as I never expected to get well enough to even have it be an option to come down on the dose, much less quit, but the time has come to try.60 tablets of carisoprodol 350mg30 tablets of 5mg valium8 tablets of 2mg ativan50 tablets 5mg oxycodone180 tablets of MSC 15mg -- but I want to avoid this beyond maybe day 1 as even cutting them up, they don't release predictable for me.I can get immodium in abundance, and prior experience suggests I'll need a lot of it. So maybe 200 tablets of that.Sodium NaproxenTylenolLoratidine (I can't take dyphenhydramine)2 doses of propoxyphene (old but probably still good)Compared to what I have seen some of you have to do this with I should be in a pretty enviable position. I have the support of a loving girlfriend during who knows I'm tapering off, but truly doesn't understand that this has become more than pain management for me, and really is into the realm of addiction now, and not just physical dependence.

{"comment": "If you want to be clean of opioids, it's best to go turkey in my experience. It's definitely not healthy but it's hard to control tapering down with the opioids you have (morphine or oxycodone). Use naproxen for headache and boneache, and use Ativan for sleeping (and start with 1mg, you don't want to end up addicted to benzodiazepines because getting off them is a lot worse than getting off opioids). As for loperamide, I have never experienced anything more than anti-diarrhoea effects and if I used it every day for like a week, then as needed, I didn't notice diarrhoea to be prolonged.If you know you can't do it, think what you want to do and what is important to you. I can tell you that it's going to be hard studying and trying to stay at some low dose and tapering down is going to be almost impossible. You may be in a weak withdrawal all the time and that's bad when you need to concentrate and learn. I would choose from 2 options, both drastic but opioid addiction is no play. You may go to a detox and you should taper down without pain with a longer lasting methadone or buprenorphine (depending where you live), but that needs more time. You may also try to get on a temporary Suboxone maintenance programme, you could stay on a low dose until you've got time to taper it down. I don't advise getting on methadone because it will suck you in, besides it makes reactions slower, can be depressing, and generally I found learning on it harder, harder than when I was on morphine or levorphanol.I wouldn't write about maintenance but you've been taking opioids for a lot of time. I'm sure your psychological addiction is deep, that's why it's going to be hard going cold turkey and you might try again and break after 3 days a few more times before you make it. But no matter how you stop taking it, the problem persists because it's in your head. I remember when I thought I was ready to stop only to relapse numerous times.That's true.

{"comment": "No maintenance. If I could ditch the docs entirely I would. After 12 years of seeing them for health issues on a near monthly basis for much of it, I grow tired of seeing a rheumatologist, a neurologoist, a pain doc, and an internist. If it hadn't been for the experimental treatment I pretty much forced them to put me on ... I likely wouldn't be having this conversation today. Everything comes with a cost though, and 5 years of pretty nasty chemotherapy took it toll on me.That is why I wanted to do a quick taper before classes started. I know this stuff is virtually impossible to do while forcing myself through classes. First few days maybe not such a big deal, but the weeks after that I only get one 5 day break during all of it, and only a week before summer classes start. Its now or not for a long time, and I'm tired of it.No matter though, I quit cold yesterday after arranging for some gabepentin to try to help the restless legs issue. Other than ginger tea, a few doses of loperamide, tylenol, and naproxen I haven't touched anything. Best side effect of the gabapentin is it makes me tired, and sleep.  I still kicked the sheets off in my sleep (as I'm sure some of the dose had worn off by then), but I stayed asleep. Day two is always a bit hard, but I didn't wake up feeling terrible...Just a bit of nausea - easily controlled with ginger tea, and could feel my GI system being a bit unhappy with me -- not major yet. I doubt the loperamide will truly control the diarrhea -- it didn't the last time I tried.This is my second time doing this, third if I count having a week off in the hospital in misery (with the support of fluids) that was not by choice. I'm determined it will be my last.  I failed the first time on my own, which is why I'm here seeking the help of those with more wisdom under their belt than I.  I'll defer to that.

{"comment": "I started out a little ass-backwards compared to most. About 4 years ago I got hooked on suboxone. I always liked the pain killers, but had very little tolerance. 4;10 mg oxycodone a day was usually my max. Maybe a few times a month.After a few years of chipping away a friend of mine landed a connect with suboxone. Now I had never had it before, nor did I know why you would have it. I started occasionally buying a pill and breaking it into 4 pieces. 2-2mg pieces a day was so much fun.After a few months of playing I realize that I had been taking them every day for 4 months. Not a complete surprise, but time flew by that 4 months. Well, needless to say, when I realized I needed to stop, it was too late.First experience with the dreaded withdrawals absolutely sucked and it lasted for about a month and a half total. 2 weeks of physically ill and 4 weeks of depression and lethargy. Suboxone kicked my ass. I spent hours reading about how bad this stuff was. I was shocked and disappointed in myself.Fast forward 3 years and still completely clean. I hurt my back a year earlier and the pain only got worse, so I decided to see a doctor. He put me on 10mg Percocet 4 times daily. Things went great until I realized I was just getting high off of them.I went 7 months taking them and the last 2 months I was taking 100mg + per day. I decided to go cold turkey and it was very intense and painful. I had no meds or knowledge of what would help. I stayed clean for 3 months and decided to start chipping away again and here I am now. I am taking around 60-80 mg per day of either hydrocodone or oxy contin.I have about 8-5mg hydros and 11-3.75 hydros left (7.5s split in half). I also have about a qp of some Bali Kratom along with 20 Xanax and 60-10mg Dexedrine.  This is my kit and I am hoping to be done with the worst of it by Tuesday when I go back to work.This is day one and not do bad yet. Tok 10mg hydro and 1 dose of kratom.

{"comment": "If you have a chance to taper it down, why not substitute all your dosage with Kratom? Different structure makes cross-tolerance less (e.g. I needed less than 40mg of levorphanol to substitute 200mg morphine i.v.). Right now you probably don't need Xanax at all if you took some opioids. After lowering the dosage, I would use 0.5 to 1mg of alprazolam when I'd have problems to fall asleep because of anxiety.

{"comment": "Yes, Kratom is legal in most of the US. I think Indiana is the only one I can think of that has made it illegal. It will almost 100% alleviate your symptoms and may actually put you in a good mood. You will need to dose about 4 grams, 3 times a day for the first few days, but then cut back and by day 10 you should be able to put it down without any major withdrawal symptoms.The amount of Imodium you are taking is only enough to stop the diarrhea. You need more along the lines of 24mg (12 pills) to put a dent in your withdrawals. Take 2-3 tagament with a large glass of white grape fruit juice about 30 minutes prior to the loperamide (Imodium). White grape fruit juice is disgusting, but it does help. Buy knock offs at Walgreens/cvs. Tagament= Cimetidine and Imodium= Lopperamide. Make sure it's just those ingredients.  From what I hear, neurontin is a pretty big help.I am currently taking only kratom 3 times a day with 2.5 mg Vicodin twice daily (morning and evening). It has been almost painless. I did a quick taper as you can read from above. I will be splitting the Vicodin in half tomorrow and will maintain that dose for 2 days and then I'm done. Kratom only for 2 weeks and I will taper that down the whole time and then I'm done completely.If you're quitting for good, take your time. If you are just maintaining, then have fun with these available products.As far as Kratom, all you need is the basic Bali powder. It's somewhere in the range of 8-15$ an oz and can be found on the Internet or at the head shop. Head shops will generally gouge you because they are likely buying from the same place you are. If you want to actually catch a nice little buzz, you will want the UEI. Very expensive though.Let me know if you need anything else. I will gladly pass on any information I have.

So day six was a blurr in the hospital (they gave me saline and the most ativan they can give, so the nurse said). I got home and saw that my kratom came in. day seven I took three doses of six gram bali powder (I mixed it with pudding as that is the only way I could stomach it and not taste it at all) and 20 mg lope. today I plan on 3 doses of 5 grams kratom and 15 mg lope. Should I stop the lope? Stop the kratom? Taper both? Also do I have a long way to go for the acute wd and can you tell the difference between acute wd and paws? Thank you in advance.Also I have been on opiates the majority of my life. Vics at age 13-16, OC's at 17-19, H at 19+ I have jumped around after that from H to dones to bupe and back and forth until the last five years just dones. I am sure I will have to deal with paws because I am 30yrs old so my receptors are saturated. what is the longest case of paws anyone has heard of?", "date": "04-03-2013", "time": "01:09", "datetime": 1362359340},
{"comment": "Not a lot of people know about Kratom or how great Kratom can be. After I got out of rehab and started itching for pills again I started taking Kratom and that is what kept me off the pills for 7 months. Once you have ZERO...i mean ZERO tolerance for any opiates...Kratom will feel like a miracle. I had no tolerance and all I had to take was 5 pills twice a day and it was just like a medium-high opiate feel. Even now that i am back on the pills and I have several days that I can't get anything I get Kratom...It doesn't get me high anymore but it eases the W/D and anxiety. I wish I could answer some of your questions but I am not understanding some of your terminology. Sorry. Remember you don't need to take A LOT of Kratom to get high or help W/D. Taking a lot of it will just put you to sleep. Which to me is a waste because you can take a sleeping pill for that.", "date": "04-03-2013", "time": "02:59", "datetime": 1362365940},

{"comment": "Been lurking for the longest time, but as I am now on the third day (hour 58) of heroin cold-turkey withdrawal, I figure I minus well add one more personal experience to the withdrawal mega-thread.  Just a background to the St Louis scene, our heroin comes in two forms: #4 raw and buttons (I've never seen black tar around here).  A button is when raw has been pre-mixed in a coffee grinder with Dormin (otc sleep aid containing an ingredient in Benadryl) and the mix scooped into gel-tabs.  Supposedly 50/50, but varies daily (Roughly 50mg dormin//50mg raw).My first run-in with heroin was for several months in a row last summer, insufflated only, of .2 to .4 of decent STL raw daily.  I withdrew cold-turkey, and it wasn't too bad. But silly me, I had this feeling that there was something I had missed, and I eventually returned to the heroin scene, this time with the intentions of seeing what it was like to be an IV user. Strangely, I enjoyed shooting buttons more than raw, the dormin seemed to add to the experience. Now into the 3rd month of being an IV user, I started to realize what being 'strung' out really meant. I've gone, 24, sometimes 48 hours sober a few times over this run, but generally a morning/night shot user.  My dosage was kept fairly low still, around 250mg to 300mg daily, never exceeding 500mg.Anyways, this is a withdrawal thread:Last shot: 12AM Friday night/Saturday morning, sleep around 3AM.Day 1 (Saturday):  Because of the late dose, no withdrawal effects felt until Saturday afternoon, runny nose, dilated pupils, slightly sore legs, hot/cold.  1mg of xanax to sleep.Day 2 (Sunday): Woke with severe depressive thoughts. Same symptoms as day 1, by mid-afternoon RLS had kicked in to full effect, pain slowly working its way from my calfs, to thighs, until finally reaching my hips.  Very uncomfortable, but not unbearable.  Anxiety hit hard. Hot/cold flashes were also very strong.  Was able to eat breakfast and dinner, as well as drink several glasses of water. Went for a late night walk to try and ease RLS. Sleep was very hard to come by, even with .5mg of xanax and 300mg of tramadol (which did nothing to reduce symptoms).  Finally fell asleep sometime after 3am despite severe RLS.  It was a very long day...Day 3 (Monday - Today): Woke up feeling fairly refreshed, no depression.  RLS still lingering, but not painful yet, just a need to constantly move my legs.  I haven't done much but sit around in my robe, but as of yet my nose is slightly runny, and a bit cold, but then again its cold outside.  Pupils still extremely dilated, somewhat painful to my eyes.  But on the whole feeling much better than yesterday morning.  Honestly feel I have enough energy to make it out of the house today.I expected my withdrawals to be much worse this time because of IV ROA, but it seems to be nearly the same as my first round with sniffing the dope.  I'm assuming keeping my dosage low has alot to do with the severity of withdrawals.", "date": "18-03-2013", "time": "17:05", "datetime": 1363626300},

{"comment": "Hi all...this is my first post!  I want to say a huge thank you for giving me info about loperamide for withdrawal.  I have an illness called RSP.  This illness causes all kinds of weird, painful things, mostly involving my feet and legs.  My feet have atrophied into what looks like two claws, and I often have massive joint swelling, making joints feel like they are filled with boiling water and sharp knives, sticking me from the inside.  I am prescribed fentanyl patches(75 mcg every 48 hours), and these are very effective.The problem I have been facing of late is that I am going through menopause (I'm 53).  I have hot flashes throughout the day and night sweats all night.  These issues make my skin constantly wet...kind of hard to keep the patches attached to my skin.  They fall off, get lost, at night I find them in the sheets, during the day they are stuck anywhere in my clothes, or gone altogether.Two months ago,I found myself, for the first time in over four years of wearing them, two days short on my prescription.  I had never experienced withdrawal, but boy, I did then.  I WAS TERRIFIED!  I ended up in the ER, and despite the fact that I held my prescription, which could be filled in two days time, the+#by Dr. told me that she would not \"enable me to abuse my medication\"and I was sent to detox.  What a nightmare!  I was horribly anxious, hot and cold, my legs kicking wildly, every awful withdrawal symptom times ten.  I was given suboxone and other stuff, but it only helped a little.So,one day after arriving at detox,my husband picked me up, we went to CVS and filled my prescription.  I swore that I would never go through that again.  I found your site, and after much reading, decided on keeping a bottle of loperamide, tagamet, and grapefruit juice.So, thanks again to menopause symptoms,I found myself short on my fentanyl patches.  I started the regime with one tagament, followed a half an hour later by a large glass of grapefruit juice, then 50 mg of loperamide.  I waited for something to happen, either withdrawal symptoms or maybe a slight opium Buzz?YAHOO!!!!!!! No withdrawal symptoms at all.  I felt a bit sleepy, and fell asleep around 8pm, slept through the night, feeling really good.  I repeated the same routine in the morning,than once again that evening.  The next morning I got my RX filled.What a miracle.  Thank you a zillion times over.  I now have a reasonable way to deal with menopause, fentanyl withdrawal and the horrible symptoms I dealt with before.

I'm pretty terrified as my last withdrawal which was about a month ago, was absolutely brutal, an that was with a relatively rapid Suboxone taper (5 days). Prior to that detox I had been using between 1 and 2 grams of heroin daily (I smoke it no IV at all). Anyways the last detox I was in a treatment centre for as I had gone through that facility previously and my parents put me back in to detox as they didn't want me trying to go cold turkey at their place. Anyways I relapsed pretty quickly after that and have been using about the same amount as before for about three weeks. My intention was to \"just get high once\" as the last thing I wanted was to go through that horrible withdrawal again but obviously that didn't happen. Anyways, any ideas of how bad it's going to be? As I said I've only been using for about three weeks but pretty heavily. I've been searching around the site and have got some ideas to make it a bit easier..Imodium and benzos are what I'm thinking. I also got 10 oxy 20s from a friend..not sure how much those will help?

{"comment": "HelloI would like to know a bit more about opioid withdrawal as I'm trying to understand how various neurobiological mechanisms are implicated in the experience of pleasure. In essence, what I want to know is:Can a person going through opioid withdrawal experience euphoric feelings or strong pleasure (when listening to music for example) or does the withdrawal completely block these? To elaborate a bit more...The state of being in withdrawal itsel is obviously highly dysphoric and non-euphoric. But is it possible to induce pleasure by actively engaging in pleasurable activities like, say, getting an orgasm, listening to some euphoric music of your choice or eating a bunch of sweet chocolate?It is my understanding that going through opioid withdrawal is partially the opposite of having an opioid high: whereas when high on opioids you can just lie down doing nothing and feel awesome, in withdrawal in this same scenario you feel like shit. If the opioid high is strong enough, there is very little reason to engage in rewarding activities as just being and doing nothing is so rewarding already. So how does this relate to the withdrawal - obviously doing stuff in general is very healthy as it gets the mind off the withdrawal and is healthy for the body as well, but is it possible to feelwithout drugs when going through opioid withdrawal? Take your favorite song that normally makes you feel euphoric without any drug - how does it work when you're in withdrawal? Also, how does acute vs. post-acute withdrawal syndromes compare in this sense?Enormous appreciation for anyone who answers - I truly need this knowledge.And finally: all of you dealing with withdrawal, I wish you a lot of strength. I have never experienced drug withdrawal but I have nevertheless been in an incredibly deep, dark place for many months.

{"comment": "I've gone through all phases of opioid addiction... The first rush and nod completely careless, free from all the pain, and feeling safe away from the cruel world. Then the phase you start realizing you need it every day, because otherwise you can't function normally chilled out or at least not giving a damn about stupid things - that's when you're psychologically hooked. I didn't realize how deeply physically I am addicted to morphine, even when I went through full blown withdrawal lasting ~2 weeks. Later I got into the phase when I could leave early at school and go over 150km by bus to get heroin when morphine and other pharm opioids became unavailable. It was then obvious I was really hooked physically. Then I stopped getting the old euphoria from opioids, but I still had my chamber of peace. And I did opioids to kill the nerves and run away from things bothering me in real life that other people didn't even think about. I lost interest in chasing the next dose and I got sick of junkies addicted to opioids and doing awful things. I moved myself on methadone. Bad, bad decision, it made me indifferent to many things I can enjoy now, even if it's a negative emotion, I prefer it that way - to feel it all. Getting off methadone eventually has cost me getting on Suboxone. Now I've been trying to get off Suboxone and sadly since I got down to 2mg, I can feel some mental need for more, otherwise I'm very moody and nervous. Right now I'm sick and tired of buprenorphine, although it surely saved my ass many times, because otherwise I would have relapsed a few times already. And after all this I still know that when I'm off Suboxone, I will be tempted all the time at every corner. :/", "date": "13-07-2013", "time": "03:43", "datetime": 1373686980},

{"comment": "MIXING ADVICE PLEASE!!HI!a friend loves opiates and when prescriptions were running out too quick, turned to H, as many do (bumped it, maybe 1g/day for a few months). soooooo....bills are due and shit needs to get done and this friend thinks its time to take a break for a while. last sober stint lasted 5 years so not so bad, minus the occasional perc use during the winter when its boring and nice to snuggle up.long story short...this friend has stocked up on helper outers for this endeavor back to sobriety. today is day 2 of no opiates/h! he walks! he has (13) 8mg suboxones. take 4mg at the most at one time and then 2 mg throughout the day as needed (no more than 8mg/day). friend also has a plenty of 10mg diazepam, plenty of .5mg clonazepam, bunch of gabapentin, and some crack cocaine, and lunesta.I understand this combination of drugs could be lethal and want to make sure this friend is using them the right way.rule 1: never take lunesta and diazepam or clonazapam together.he typically will take some bupe in the morning to get right. if he is really hurting he will take 10-15mg of diazepam to snooze or chill. this also occurs in the evening. sometimes he will skip the diazepam and take lunesta instead for that night just to keep things mixed up and not reliant on one drug.question is, can this person take a hit of crack cocaine every once in a while without any chances of dying after taking some suboxone or a valium??  lets say he takes 4mg suboxone, then takes a hit of crack cocaine (not a favorite choice, but helps with a little energy kick during these depressing and tiresesome detox days) and chills for a while. is it safe to take 10mg diazepam an hour or two later to fall asleep? is this a waste of any of these drugs? anyone have a fun and/or cocktail of these drugs to maximize his step away from opiates. He knows all the rest of these drugs are addictive and will have to be tapered, but getting over the H monster is his first concern.sorry if this is in the wrong place. I have lurked this site forever now and familiar with forums, just not sure where this weird question goes. quitting? mixing? safety? thanks in advance.edit: oh yeah, this friend also always has very nice and stinky green and uses it in the evening as well occasionally, as well as tincture and/or a hard candy during the day to take away some pain.prolly should have given a back story....guess I should have let everyone know, this person has been fighting an autoimmune disease since october 2012 and has been emitted to the a top 5 hospital in the country for 8 nights and days, had biopsies, bone marrow extracts, every scan in the book, and couldn't walk for a week and eventually diagnosed with Adult Stills. He experiences much pain throughout his back/hips/legs/ankles/feet. He was on 60mg of prednisone, a daily shot to the belly daily of kineret, and was up to 80mg of oxycodone/day and convinced the doctor he had worked his way down to 10mg/day, but has been supplementing instead with street relief, because doctors have been strict with scripts, was booted from pain management for THC (after requesting to be put in it to help ween all the pills!!!) ridiculous and it was handled in the most ass backwards way one could imagine. not to mention his wife is an oncologist at this hospital. (wish laws werent so strict so he could just get all the scripts in the world, but would never put her career in danger)the fact his wife is a doctor at this hospital makes my whole situation even more sensitive. he needs to be discrete as possible and wants to turn this around and turn time back a year to the man he was. being the bread winner. the man of the house. physically fit and energized. they just bought their first house. 5 bedroom on 3.25 acres. would really would like to put my money to some good use (for now lol). this friend will never completely kick opiates. there is nothing like it and he always commend the grandfather from 'Little Miss Sunshine'. he would live my life just like him in his situation. he wishes he could live it like that right now, but not in the cards.wow....sorry for the long ass first post. friend of mine is up right now cause of that cc.

Ive been told in my life numerous times that something was literally not possible, then guess what, i did it.My pain, for example, no doctor could figure it out, everyone kept telling me \"you'll be in pain for the rest of your life\" then the pain doctors \"you'll be in pain forever, we can just help you manage it.\" family doc, urologists (three of em), surgeons, you name it, all the same. Guess what? I got sick of the pain and decided to do my own research, came up with a plan, told the docs what to do, got surgery, month and a half later. NO PAIN. But, i was told that it was impossible to cure my pain and id have to deal with it for the rest of my life. The moment i got sick of hearing that and really did something about it, shit changes.the moment you get sick of having an addiction control your life, the moment you decide that enduring the WD is worth it, and the future moments where you decide not to fall back into habit are your choice, your will, and your strength.I understand addictions and dependency, ive had both, and ive kicked both.Last edited by bronson; 26-07-2013 at.post merge", "date": "26-07-2013", "time": "06:09", "datetime": 1374818940},

They do subutex detox but you have to be on the grounds for 12 hoursHere's the strange part: after taking the phenobarbital I was not sick at all. My pupils went to little round circles --not pinned but slightly bigger, round, circles that didn't respond to light. Went right to sleep. They would redose like every 8 hours, I slept with no withdrawal symptoms to the point I actually refused the subutex.  Didn't need it. I took the pheno for three days, only waking to redose and eat. 72 hours later I still felt no withdrawal but extremely disoriented and fuzzy headed so I stopped the pheno. About a day and a half later felt normal, the fuzzy headed feeling went away. Felt completely normal. I didn't sleep great for about a week tho.All in all, it was the easiest detox I ever had! Never felt one withdrawal symptom. Why?? I have no idea other than the fact I slept through it all.

{"comment": "Nothing like being unable to get regular sleep all because of withdrawals. Out of benzos AND opiates for another day or so... booze it is. A hefty stash of clonidine once again to the rescue. I'm left with (only) serious weakness and fatigue, and the occasional peripheral adrenergic reminder to take some more clonidine. Basically I pretty much have to stay in bed as much as possible, but despite that, I'm still unable to sleep.The clock-watching is probably the worst part. Unless I have some sort of successful distraction, I'm checking it 15 minutes or so. Might not sound so bad but that's nearly a hundred times a day... and if I just decided to ride this out, I use hydromorphone almost exclusively but would still have heavy acute withdrawals for well over a week.Anybody else get the chills on overdrive while withdrawing? I'm not talking about bouts of feeling cold, I mean in the way you can respond to different music, films, etc, with goosebumps and that chill down your spine. It may happen to me a few times a year but just today I've gotten at least two dozen times. Some of them so intense it's like a full body orgasm..As far as PAWS anxiety, tough it up. I've got severe GAD, SAD, but and panic disorder and while opiates help somewhat, I managed far longer without them. And for 4 years or so, I've even been prescribed benzos. And yet I've never been in benzo withdrawal (even with cessation). Just take it properly. Don't take it every day. And if you really have to, make sure it's a short ass acting benzo (weak hypnotics that come to mind are Xanax and Ativan), once a day. And you should probably still take a break on the weekends, or a few days a week either way.The anxiety you may feel with PAWS is my daily bane, and it seems it will like be so for the rest of my life, to the point where I can't even realistically imagine a future where I DON'T take my life within a few years. But I've felt like I that for years, and I'm still here. If I can do it, I'm sure you can endure it for several weeks or even months.Last edited by bronson; 31-07-2013 at.post merge", "date": "31-07-2013", "time": "21:22", "datetime": 1375305720},

I snorted 30mg-60mg of Roxies a day for almost 2 years. i never went past oral or snorting it..I tried w/d's with out any help and no success, so this time around Im attempting it with 5 days supply of 30mg adderall capsules.First day was lil tough and decided to go with one dose of 30mg capsule time release. I made myself eat 2 waffles before I took it at 8:30am and by 9am it was ON. Keep in mind you will not have appetite till around 9pm.. Great time till about 5pm. Thought of taking another, but I would have never fell a sleep.. So I decided to get some grapefruit juice, great idea because it kicked back in till 9pm. That's when the crash happened, no energy, sore, cramps. I took 1mg of xanex and feel asleep at 10pm or so and slept with no problems till 7am..I just was to throw it in as I'm attempting this I work from 9am-9pm at my own restaurant and I can't Not Be There.Second day woke up at 7 with a cup of coffee \"as always\" and made myself eat again. Than took another dose of 30mg adderall at 8:30am and I'm sitting here on my break and its 3pm still good.. Repeated the process on the second day with succes.As I'm writing this its day 3 cold turkey. I did exactly the same as I had for last 2 days and still good, but adderall is wearing off earlier each day. Since my doses are in capsules I opened up one and took out about 1/4 of capsule beads. I wouldn't recommend full dose, most likely will result in NO SLEEP. Going to continue with 1mg of Xanax after 9pm or earlier if the anxyity intensifies. Remember adderall is also addictive and can have big withdrawals also, if you never taken adderall I would recommend to do some research on it before you attempt this.I would recommend some kind of Loperamide Hydrochloride, <-6$ at local pharmacy or even gas stations carry some kind..I'm 225 lb and 2 mg work great for whole day and I was able to use the bathroom once a day, so far. Make sure some 800mg of ibuprofen for the muscle aches, it helped me.Keep in mind, not all people react the same and my whole objective was to stay busy. Not hard with adderoll,etc read and time will fly by.I'm not a doctor or have any experience in the medical field, all this info is from personal experience.I hope I helped some of y'all, I know by reading these posts this process has been, well I can't say pleasant but def easier than before attempts..

{"comment": "Hi all,wellim 2 days into opiate withdrawal.   Ive been using heroin on and off the last 10 months, not daily at first, just once or twice a week.  Then the last month i used more often and ended up using for 2 weeks straight.Was only using small ammount a day, but opiates is opiates.....so here i am on day 2 of cold turkey.Have been using gabapentin for last 6  days to help with W/Ds, though i only quit heroin 2 days ago -  - only 2 x 300mg pills a day - i plan on taking another 2x 300mg tomoz, and then 1x300mg pill for 2 days , then quit them and ride the rest of the cold turkey out.So anybody got any advice please, am i safe to do what i am doing?anybody else used gabapentin like this?Im also coming to the end of a 6 month bout of chemo therapy treatment, and the opiates gave me respite from the awful side effects of the drug.I dont like the gabapentin as it makes me feel 'drunk' and off 'balance'. not in a nice way, kinda like being spaced out, blurry eyes and wobbly when i walk.  Thats drom a low dose of gabapentin, ive read that most opiate users take massive ammounts of the gabapentin for W.Ds....God knows how they manage that lol.still the effects of the gabapentin are better than full blown withdrawals.  But after i get the first 3 days outa the way im quitting the gabapentin as i dont want to be addicted to that too.Any advice or words of wizdom is appreciated.Thanks.", "date": "03-09-2013", "time": "12:22", "datetime": 1378210920},

Obviously, the more gradual you decrease your dose, the easier the withdrawals will be.. but that means a lot longer period of tapering. If you want to do it faster, you'll have to make bigger jumps down in dosage which will be more uncomfortable.See if you can handle taking 25% less each day.Tapering fully with ones DOC is very hard. That's why drugs like methadone and buperenorphine are popular. For your case, I definitely wouldn't advise methadone, but bupe might be good for you.

I used hydrocodone for a couple of years with very gradual increases.  With the oxy the increases were more frequent.  I remember being at 120 mg, taking 20 mg pills & thinking that wasn't to bad & i could taper.  Next thing i know i am not \"feeling it\" at 120 & at the end of my run (now) I would easily take 300-360 a day, every day, of the 30 mg pills- crazy amounts.  The  high was so nice then it would only last an hour, then half hour & I kept chasing that good feeling the rest of the day.  I kept trying to taper & would do ok for a few days then \"reward\" myself by using high amounts again.  I just couldn't get off the oxy.  The hydro i tapered but the oxy is just to hard for me.  I went to a doctor, an addiction specialist to taper & he put me on oxycontin 80 mg twice a day with oxycodone to equal my usual dose then started tapering me.  I still couldn't do it so now I am getting set to do the short sub taper with another doctor (i am older with health issues, that's why i have to use a doctor), this Sunday i should be able to start.  I am a bit concerned because i am on extended release but hopefully 24 hours will be enough.  I have comfort meds so i should be ok.IMHO the only way to taper is write it out on paper (or computer spread sheet), have someone strong hold your pills & dole them out to you or get one of those pill safes so you can only get a certain amount per day.Maybe you are stronger than me & can taper, if you can hate what the pills have done to you that may be enough to get off.

And new to all of this and I need some advice or information if anyone can help me out please.I was injured about 10 years ago and after three major back surgeries my doctor prescribed dilaudid 8 mg orally 4 times daily. I have been taking that same prescription now for almost 8 years or more, I have never taken an extra pill and always took it as prescribed except some days I would only take 3 instead of 4. Now my back is strengthening and I want to stop the prescription if possible. I tried stopping without knowing what these pills really were and ended up feeling the aches etc after about 12 hours and took a pill and it went away. I realized I would need help after that and contacted a local hospital that has a rehab center in it and she said that it would take about a week in the hospital to get off of these things and that they would assist me in doing so.My question is this, What should I expect to go through with them helping me get off of these things? I have a heart problem and read on here it could cause heart attacks etc? Is that something I should worry about or will they keep me safe and comfortable through this. I just want off of them so I dont have to take them every day. But after reading all of these WD symptoms on here it seems almost worth just taking the pill. lol Ive never been to a rehab or experienced anything like this so just wondered what to expect and what she means at the hospital when she says they will give me meds and stuff to keep me comfortable while getting off of them?

So I've been having back problems on and off for a few years and It got severely bad 2 months ago.  My doctor (who is against putting me on anything due to my history) put me on 120MG of oxycodone daily to keep me able to get around until we found out what's wrong.Then the surgeon bumped me up to 2 OC40's daily along with 40mg of percocet for breakthrough or additional use if/when needed.  On top of that I had some percocet left over from a past episode and I'm now taking the 2OC80's and about 200MG of percocet daily.I've had the back surgery a week and a half ago.  It was a success, all of the pain from pre-surgery is gone.  I have some pain from the surgery itself but it's not too bad (but It's really hard to tell cause I'm still on a lot of meds).Anyway, they're supposed to taper me off, starting today.  I want to get this over with ASAP!  I'm tired of being on this.  I'm depressed, my sober friends are telling me to stop cold turkey and go through W/D and get it over with.I have 25 suboxone that someone gave me if I wanted to go that route.  Does anyone have any advice?  If I should decide to do the suboxone, how should I start?How much?How do I avoid precipitated w/d?What do I do if that happens?In need of help...scared and just want this to be over.Also....the last two days I tried to stop...or hold out as long as I could.  Yesterday I made it to 2:15 before the W/d got bad enough and I gave in (kept my total use to 180Mg & 1 OC at bedtime.Today i woke up and it was bad right away.  Took 50mg at 9 and 30 at 10:30.  Seems to be keeping the wd away, but I'm not happy, not comfortable, miserable etc.Also....I have off the rest of this week, so I don't have to deal with work, but I do have my wife and kids here every day after 4...I'd hate to be going through w/d while they're here.

{"comment": "I've been on opiates for 14 years now; and have been on Suboxone for 2 of those years. Over the past 6.5 months I have tapered from 12mg daily to 2-4mg daily of sub. Here's what has helped:1. Healthy Diet. I cook vegetarian food for myself and my boyfriend, but I'm not strict about it. What I am strict about is always eating fresh food, never drinking soda (10 years and counting), and never eating fast food (13 years and counting.) I quit nicotine in 2008. It's common sense that eating well makes you feel well. I've found that eating really well--mostly veggies, fruits, and lean protein like fish--makes my withdrawals that much more tolerable.2. Exercise. This has been the single most helpful defense against withdrawals that I've found. I just make myself do 30 minutes a day. Getting the body accustomed to producing natural endorphins is the key here. It's also a good way of distracting myself from the discomfort of withdrawing. I switch it up to avoid getting bored: I do yoga, hike, walk, have sex, jog....if it's outside it feels even better. The more rigorous, the more sweat, the better. To reward myself and keep sweating I take a long hot sauna or hot tub--these almost make me forget about withdrawals completely.3. Vitamins and Supplements. Every morning with breakfast I take Omega 3s, Vitamins B6, B12, C, D3, Magnesium, and Folic Acid; each works to regenerate and strengthen my neurotransmitters and help soothe the nervous system. Withdrawal is just as traumatic for our brains as it is to our bodies. We have to take good care of both as we battle the withdrawals each day.4. Meds: A combo of gabapentin (WORKS WONDERS), Aleve for aches and pains, and diphenhydramine to help sleep is my daily combo of OTC + comfort meds.Just my experience so far. I'm far from being out of the woods. But I thought I'd share some tactics to perhaps help others who can relate to my story.

{"comment": "This is something I am about to go thorough for the 4-5th? Time now?It all started 2 years ago with simple 10mg Norcos. Popping 2 a day and being on cloud nine. I would typically go on \"binges\" or longer periods of use, the longest being 8 weeks. Every time, except the first time I knew I was in WD.As time went on tolerance took its course and 2 became 4 per dose then 12/day, when I switched to Roxy10mg. Again, about a 7 week run with some exalgo throw in the mix that I took apart to get at the hydromorphone w/o the time release. I ended that run June 1st. Was gone for 2 months marrying my wife, I was so high on life at the time, I barely even knew I was in WD. All I had was some headaches and some stomach issues. I thought I broke the habit being 2 months clean.Idiotically, on my return to the us, I thought oh! I can chip and use once a week! Right. That never works. Now here I am again! this time occasionally up to 150-165mg oxy/day. This dose was only for a week. I'd say on average I was on 75-90/day. Still high. It's been 8 weeks, lol. I'm done with the shit. It's lost all magic, no euphoria, just a mild mood increase. Tbh, I felt the best in years in the summer when I was opie free.I have 2 2mg Sub strips. I know it's not much, but I was going to wait for WD to kick I'm, which seems to be taking its time. Even after 24 hours lately I've shown little symptoms. I'm going to try .5 or 1 mg and see how I feel when I finally hit WD. I am mainly curious, as my history of returning to the pills countless times, if maybe I should just go on a low dose maint dose of sub to keep any craving at bay. Or does anyone think, I can taper with this 4 mg of sub, feel a little WD. I have Ativan,Valium, and Xanax on hand. And just try again at staying clean without going on maint bupe. I don't want to do any MMT.I miss the old days of 20mg hydro making me feel so great, sigh. Tolerance. Nonetheless, any insight would be appreciated. I know I'm new to posting, but I've been reading for a long time now.Should also mention I've been using more opiates and benzos as I've come home from marrying my wife, she lives outside the US and the process of getting someone here spouse or not, is a pitfa, I feel this has upped my usage significantly, I've been very stressed missing her.Last edited by Wimmiz; 13-10-2013 at.", "date": "13-10-2013", "time": "04:26", "datetime": 1381638360},

{"comment": "Hello together,so, I have been abstinent from opiates for about 2 and a half months after kicking a somewhat minor habit, having tapered down to 0,4mg Buprenorphine.Now I f'ed up by using ~300mg Tilidine/ 1mg Bupe a day with a few breaks in between but then up to the point where I would get WD-symptoms again...Over the course of the last weekend I took 2 doses of Tilidine (very short acting, potency: ~0,2) a day and then took 0,4mg Bupe once the day after my stash was empty. Now for my question/input:With Tilidines very short half-life of 4-6 hours I would get symptoms very fast and the acute WD sucks but is pretty short. By taking the Buprenorphine Tuesday after my last dose it seems to have eliminated nearly the whole acute phase. Only yesterday morning I felt a little crappy and that was solved by taking 300mg of Gabapentin. Now despite not having slept perfectly I feel absolutely fine.So it kind of \"covered up\" the first few days of otherwise very unpleasant withdrawal.

{"comment": "Hiya, The Dope Man,I agree with Mr,Scagnattie tapering to a smaller dose n then going to suboxone may be better.With suboxone it's not necessarily having to wait 24 hours but being in moderate withdrawal. There's something called the COWS scale if you look that up it will explain it better.If you go onto suboxone before moderate withdrawal, you will go into severe withdrawal as the bupe will knock the opiate off the mu receptors.Can I ask if you are doing the suboxone with a doctor?  If so, n don't take my word here as I am not from the US, but by what I've heard from others is that most doctors start inducting you onto suboxone gradually over a few hours n you stay with them so they can assure your safety n wellbeing.I am from the UK myself so it, different as I took the first 8mg home n took it in 2mg doses throughout the dsy but was supervised at the pharmacy afterwards.Hope this helps. We're here for you.Evey.Hiya - just a thought but instead of going cold turkey, which, in my opinion, seems very extreme with the line of work you are doing. My addiction was codeine n I could not stand during withdrawals (however that is my experience, yours may be different), how about finding a weaker opiate and use that as a taper for a few weeks? - or maybe use suboxone on a short term basis. Some people have used suboxone for say, two to three weeks to get through the withdrawals n found that it may drag the H withdrawal out but its far less intense.Another idea is you could look into some sort of hypnotherapy or maybe some meditation to relax you.I do agree that a lot is mental n it sounds like you are smart in thinking that way. But can I ask is this going to be your first withdrawal?  Have you withdrawn from any other opiate before?  Reason I'm asking is this could help others to give you sufficient advice. Because if you've not been through it before you may be in for a shock.Please take care n we're here if you need to chat.Last edited by Eveleivibe; 03-11-2013 at.", "date": "03-11-2013", "time": "09:30", "datetime": 1383471000},

So that will help with withdrawalsI'm on day 4 at the moment coming off 400-800mg codeine a day for 2 years, day 1 and 2 were actually the worst, I didn't have access to MXE so I used some DXM alone and to potentiate my benzos for the first couple of days and I'm feeling almost normal physically now.

I've gotten bad enough that I'm now using while at work to hold withdraw at bay (very long shifts). My standard dosing is two 40mg doses a day and it's worked very well for me. So I made overtime recently at work which means that I'm at work for 48 hours straight, and withdraw was starting to get kind of intense, so I took 30mg of hydro to stop some of the uncomfortable withdraw symptoms and maybe a little sedation so I can sleep tonight. I still feel like I want to jump out of my skin, racing heart chills ect. Does withdraw cause you to need a higher dose until you get back on track? I'm really at the limit of what I can afford to take per day as prices are high in my area and my doc gives me enough to last me 3 days that's supposed to last a month.

{"comment": "Thanks for the reply.Nucynta is Tapentadol. It is an opioid but much weaker than Oxycodone...supposed to be between Tramadol and Morphine apparently as far as analgesia...supposedly 15mg Oxycodone = 100mg Nucynta/Tapentadol. My Dr. wanted me to try them but they don't do much for me. I still have 14.5 X 50mg left and was thinking of using them to wean myself and avoid WD. But they also have SNRI properties to them.I have a ton of Tramadol though, handfuls in various pill bottles plus another box of 60 or 90. They are the Tramacet with 325mg APAP/Acet. Again, another mild opioid.I was also considering Codeine, which I have a good few as well.At the same time I want to cleanse my body from opioids completely so that I can have it out of my system for a period of time. In between I will probably need to continue to use Nucynta or Tramacet for when I have pain and just deal with it and I'm not sure how that is going to effect my Oxycodone tolerance.The real truthful reason I don't want to wean with Oxycodone is because honestly, I like them too much. I will always start tomorrow (that never seems to come) and just get deeper and deeper as far as tolerance goes (and it is already way to high for my liking). I need to gut it out and get back down to 20mg or so, which will probably take a few months.The reason I don't or can't use Hydrocodone is because my Dr. doesn't prescribe me that and I'm not going to open a can of worms. I don't think it would help much anyways.I took 200mg Nucynta on Monday night and it helped a little bit and I've taken nothing since. Already coming to Thursday now so I might as well just sweat it out (literally? lol).I've done it before a few times but I've heard it gets harder each time and it seems so. I think part of what makes it so hard is knowing that you can have something to make it all go away instantly, and you want it to all go away instantly.Opiates/oids can obviously be beneficial but they are really a tricky little animal from so many angles.

However if it persisted for say months after withdrawal then that may be different.You see opiates hit a different receptor to say Tramodol (if I'm wrong here someone please correct me n I apologise) I think it is the mu receptor that opiates latch on to so really tapering with trams isn't the best thing to do.That's my suggestions, however I'm not a doctor n only you can decide what's best for YOU.PLEASE TAKE N PM ANYTIME IF YOU'd like someone to chat to.Evey x", "date": "14-11-2013", "time": "10:11", "datetime": 1384423860},

The problem, as you correctly indicated is that it is also a bunch of other things too.Nucynta is a mu-opioid receptor agonist with SNRI. So it would also definitely mess with serotonin levels in the brain as you mentioned.Sometimes I have varying degrees of anger at my Dr. for giving those types of meds when my issue really is pain. This is also why they pile up, because I rarely take them. I don't doubt his intentions are good as he prefers I not take Oxycodone during the daytime so he tries other meds.Anyway, I've decided to just tough it out without taking anything except some vitamins and some OTC stuff to help me sleep.

{"comment": "I am seeking input about mild opiate withdrawal. I have used opiates (oxy, hydro) on occasion recreationally in low doses (never more than 10-20mg a day of oxy) for short periods (always ten days or less) with many weeks to a few months in between. So, I broke my foot pretty good 7 weeks ago, and in that time I was prescribed 80 Vicodin tabs (whatever the lowest dose is...think its 5 mg hydro) and after surgery ten days later, was prescribed 60 Percocet 5mg tabs. I used about half the vicodin tabs over a ten day period (4-5 per day) waiting for surgery, and used about half the percs in the 5-6 days after surgery (about 3-5 a day). Since that time ive used anywhere from an average of 1-4 vics or 1-3 percs a day, every single day for the last 6 weeks for the pain. Then I was given a script of Tramadol 50 mg tabs x60 last week at my follow up appt to get me off the opiates. Too late?!! I was also initially Rx'd sixty 5mg Valium and thirty 4mg Zophran tabs (odanseteron) after surgery, which I never used either one.So last week i stopped taking the Percs (had 5 left, the Vics were used up by then) and switched to Tramadol for the pain, which by now is quite minor, mainly helped with IBU or the Tramadol , one every 6-8 hours if I need it, which I dont always. So my pain is mild and I wasnt taking the Tramadol for 2-3 days either. HOWEVER...a friend gave me ten 30 mg MScontin about 10 days ago, which I took one every day for 5-6 days, which I was using recreationally...never had morphine before...pretty good, long lasting stuff!). I clearly have a low tolerance compared to many here, so i may be sounding like a whiny little bitch! Sorry if that's the case.After using one 30 mg MS Contin daily for 5-6 days, I quit taking them so I could go back to work in a few days without being on any pain meds. The third day without anything at all, except maybe I took a Tramadol or two, during that time, I had a fairly sudden onset of moderately bad abdominal cramping and mild diarrhea (cramps were worst part) in the middle of the night (got cold flashes on the shitter which I never felt before...almost as bad as the cramps), felt draggy but OK when I got up and went to my first day back at work in 7 weeks the next morning. But then started feeling worse by the hour after I got there. At the time I just thought I was having trouble adjusting to being back at work for the first time in 7 weeks. I felt pretty flu-ish (no energy (felt like just wanted to be horizontal under the covers), cold flashes, some occasional abdominal cramping, some sweating) for about 16 hours...stayed in bed from 3pm when I got home, until I went to work the next morning at 8am. In the middle of the night, it occurred to me I may be having mild withdrawal symptoms instead of the flu.Ive never been thru any opiate withdrawal, so dont know what it's like...but I got up at 2am and took a Percocet and a Zophran and went back to bed, which helped me sleep. I woke up 4 -5 hours later and I felt better and good enough to get up and go to work, something I wasnt feeling I was gonna be able to do at 2am.  So I'm guessing that i probably started going thru mild opiate withdrawal, since the percocet and Zophran \"seemed\" to make the worst of the symptoms better, but is it possible to have withdrawals taking opiates daily for 6-7 weeks at low, prescribed doses? If so, I find that somewhat surprising but not entirely without merit.So here's where I am...Ive taken half a perc twice a day and 1 Tramadol twice a day for the last 2-3 days to ward off any possible WD symptoms for now. Im down to my last 2 Percs, will get no refill and dont frankly want one. I want off the pain meds all together at this point unless for pain, which is nil for now. But I'm anxious about going thru all that again in a couple of more days when that last perc is gone...if what I experienced was actual opiate withdrawal.After much research here...does it sound to ppl here like i was having mild withdrawal, or could it have just been a 24 bug that was gonna resolve itself anyway and the timing was coincidental? Can you get withdrawals taking 5 mg Percs as prescribed for just 6-7 weeks, only taking 1-3 a day?It seems that if I was having withdrawal symptoms, that the Zophran, Valium and Tramadol will be awfully helpful getting through the rough parts. Having laid out my history and situation, I was hoping for ppl's thoughts and possible regiment to use of the Zophran, Valium and Tram.I have heard some really bad things about the tramadol, but heard it does wonders for the symptoms of withdrawal, and I have enough Tram to taper down. If my WD symptoms were to reappear in the next few days, should I start taking the Tram and taper (one 50mg Tram twice a day for 4-5 days, then half a Tram twice a day for 4-5 days, then half a Tram a day for 4-5 days, then stopping ....or should I avoid the Tram all together and stick with just the Zophran and Valium and Imodium to get through the 3-5 days of misery I could be facing?Thanks for any advice you all might have.Last edited by DocRock; 28-11-2013 at.", "date": "28-11-2013", "time": "22:39", "datetime": 1385678340},

Since 1999 I have been on one or another type of physically addictive opioid narcotic; always prescribed by a Doctor.  I remember watching movies and such way before 1995 and after that graphically explained to me what it's like going through withdrawal.  Even without anyone with real life experience like on a site, detailing the challenge and horrors of withdrawal, I had formed a very real, intensely strong idea in my mind what it would be like to go through withdrawal and that it was to be avoided at all cost.Several times through the years for differing reasons I had to reduce the number of pills I was taking abruptly and as I \"expected\" went through a very difficult experience with withdrawal.I had a series of seizures that were not directly Rx related. Without the marvels of modern medicine I would have died.  Instead, technically with the marvels of modern medicine, I died 12 times; as they were able to keep bringing me back; most importantly, the 12th time.For reasons I won't go into here, as my medical authority to chose had been removed from me because of the seizures and my inability to speak, another person had to make those choices.  The Doctors were told by this person to cold turkey me.  At that point I was previously taking MS Contin 4X daily & Xanax 4X daily; don't recall the MG but it was the max FDA allowed per pill for both.  The seizures left me temporarily (thank God) partially brain damaged.  I could not remember any of those movies and stories I was told throughout my life about withdrawal for about 10 days.For those 10 days I suffered nothing close to the level of withdrawals one would expect for stopping cold turkey at the MG level I was at per day.  I suffer ZERO chills & hot flashes.  I suffered ZERO stomach & digestive issues. I was eating everything they put in front of me as if it was my last meal.Does the mind control a large part of how our body reacts in the manor we believe it should?  Is this site & other information sources helping or hurting you to learn about how withdrawal ?\"will\"? be for you?  I've learned the mind is a very powerful weapon when it is believing the right thing and what I put in it is very important to my well being.

I'm glad to hear you are doing so well after such potentially horrific experience and I hope your pain is well controlled now?I have a question about managing the change from one kind of opiate to another, and I'd be really grateful for any advice you can give. If this is in the wrong place please feel free to move it, but I couldn't find any topic in pain management that felt like it quite fitted. I'm a long term chronic and acute pain patient, my condition is untreatable and incurable so pain management is all they've got, and I'm treated off label with palliative doses, though I don't have a date of expiration currently estimated. I have found that Targinact (slow release Oxycodone and naloxone) with oxynorm as breakthrough have been the best combination in terms of keeping my pain under control without making me so drowsy I can't function. So tolerance has arrived, after three years, as predicted, and I'm now needing 120mg targinact BD and 80-100mg breakthrough TD. My pain team have suggested its time to try cycling me off of oxy at the crazy doses and for me to have 3-4months of fentanyl patches at 100mcg and 30mg oxynorm for breakthrough. My consultant suggested that the first 7-10 days of the switch will be really tough, but that I need to try not to take too much breakthrough to g through it. Is there anything else I can do/take to help me through the oxy withdrawal while the fentanyl kicks in? I'd be so grateful for any suggestions.Last edited by bronson; 01-12-2013 at.post merge", "date": "29-11-2013", "time": "20:36", "datetime": 1385757360},

Along with the Suboxone, they got me through some of the worse H/methadone w/d's I've ever personally experienced after doing it for years and years straight.Clonidine 0.1-0.2 mg 4 times a day as needed (space them out every 4 hours)Gabapentin (Neurontin) 300mg CAP 3 times a day (for nerve pains IE:restless legs)Baclofen 20 mg 4 times a day OR Methocarbam (Robaxin) 750 mg 4 times a day (for pain)Dicyclomine (Bentyl) 20 mg 4 times a day (for stomach cramps)Trazodone 100-300 mg at bedtime OR Doxepin 50-150 mg at bedtime (for sleep)Imodium (for diarrhea obviously)Also look into the Vivitrol Shot (Extended Naltrexone Release) if you don't feel like you have the will power to stay clean initially.If you prefer a more natural way for the sleep aids and are trying to stay away from them I would personally suggest two things. Either taking a combination of Melatonin, Valarian Root, and Passion Flower (mix and match to your own liking...I personally like all three). Also I've had many people swear by a tea that they drink right before going to bed \" Yogi - Bedtime \" I guess it has a lot of good natural sleep aids in it.Hope I could be of help and good luck kicking this shit... it's a fucking bitch", "date": "22-12-2013", "time": "09:33", "datetime": 1387704780},
{"comment": "When I quit Suboxone (tapered down from 8 to 1mg over a month or so, then jumped off - was taking for 2 years, at doses as high as 20) I found the most beneficial thing to do was walk. I spent the first two or three days sitting on my couch watching tv, feeling like shit, horrible restless legs, not sleeping a wink, but the worst aspect by far was the sucking pit of anxious dread. And the looping thoughts. So I started walking my dog, taking him on progressively harder walks/hikes up hills and for longer amounts of time. I would usually listen to a podcast I enjoyed or some music an walk.This might sound facetious or ridiculous to others who've gone through an intense (whatever that is to the individual) withdrawal and it probably wouldn't help or be possible with a more acute withdrawal from an opiate with a much shorter half life, but I don't know. But for the protracted withdrawal from Suboxone and especially the PAWS, this walking I was doing was basically the only thing that took my mind off what I was going through, restless legs were nullified, and it must have helped me sleep. Plus exercise is always a good thing.So that's what I have to add. And the reason to wanted to add it is because I've never really seen it posted on forums, though people do profess the benefits of \"working out.\" Which I did try, but the stop start of a resistance routine was kind of tortuous. Though the meditative quality of walking for hours provided huge amounts of relief for me, and I think it quickened the coming of sleep and finally getting back into working out after the worst was over.All the best to anyone going through a withdrawal or contemplating it.", "date": "28-12-2013", "time": "22:01", "datetime": 1388268060},
{"comment": "I too have found clonidine to be one of the most helpful medications to use for withdrawals.  It helps with RLS, sleep, anxiety, high blood pressure (which is its intended use anyways), night sweats, and some other general discomfort.  The only downside of it is that it leaves you with little energy so you really can't be productive when using it to kick, so if you have to work while kicking you should save it for after work.One of the other reasons that I like it for withdrawals is that it's not an opiate so it will not prolong the withdrawals at all.  If you have a few days to just lay around at home while kicking an opiate habit then clonidine is one of the best drugs to use during that time.  When I had access to it it was the only drug that I used for the withdrawal symptoms, and it made things a lot more manageable.I have only used gabapentin once, but I would imagine that it would be pretty similar to clonidine in terms of the symptoms that it alleviates, as well as it's benefit of not being an opiate so no issues with prolonging the withdrawals.  A lot of people actually prefer these drugs over benzos when kicking, and it has the benefit of not causing worse withdrawals from the drug itself like benzos can do after using it for a week or so straight.  Another downside of using benzos during withdrawal is that they lower inhibitions which causes some people to get the 'fuck-its' and use opiates again, so these other drugs also eliminate that problem.  I've only used the clonidine for 3-5 days of withdrawal, and it can cause slight withdrawals but nothing that taking a lower dose for 2 more days won't fix.Last edited by Tommyboy; 29-12-2013 at.", "date": "29-12-2013", "time": "05:40", "datetime": 1388295600},

{"comment": "Hey everyone, so I have been taking opiates for a few yrs now, started in August 2011 and and quit august 2012 for a good 3-4 months. Started using a in December 2012 til February 2013. Once again quit till about May and used off an on. But in between off and on I used lopermide to ease withdrawal. Like an idiot I didn't know what I was getting into. Now it's January 2014. Should have said this early but the first stint was only hydro 10. Then this time around it's been oxy 80's about two aday. Then up until New Year's Eve I took  2 80's on nyeve and 1 more New Year's Day and 1 more on January 2nd. Then started the lopes and tapered. I went from 18mgs in the am and pm. To now about 8mgs in the am and pm. Should I continue to taper down to nothing or just jump off? It's been about 7 days straight of lopes about about 2 weeks striaght of 80's before that. Should I expect a long and drown out withdrawl?

{"comment": "I would recommend continuing to taper down.  If you drop 1mg from each dose (so 2mg a day) and then just drop 1mg from the nightly dose once you get down to 4mg then you are not looking at much longer on the drug so I think the smoother transition that may have slightly longer mild withdrawals would be better than abruptly stopping and having more intense withdrawals that might only be a little shorter than if you tapered.I know that in many cases the duration that you are on a drug can play a bigger role in the withdrawals than the dose you jump at but anything that you use to taper with for just 2-3 weeks should be fine as it really isn't dragging it out too long and it's really not that much time on that drug to allow for things to get too messy.", "date": "11-01-2014", "time": "05:52", "datetime": 1389419520},

{"comment": "Just went from being a several-year lurker of this site to an active poster. I feel like I might be able to help those in this thread looking for some help/hope getting through opiate withdrawal.First, a bit of history:I started using opiates regularly (more than once in a while) about 3 years ago. I was 18 at the time. My sister was with this boy who smoked oxycodone and he got her into it. She brought it home and I was more than eager to try it. Needless to say I fell in love immediately. Her and I were a tag-team of mischief, stealing money from our mother, selling/pawning everything we could in order to score. I quickly geared my mind toward being economical and abandoned smoking them immediately in favor of more efficient ROA's. Depending on how much I had I would snort or plug them (and if I had plenty, both at once).This went on for a several months, but I never actually had access to it enough to be able to develop a tolerance or a physical dependance.I moved in with a girl I met when I was 19. Her house was pretty much the epitome of a crack house. No power, no hot water, a huge hole in the roof covered by tarp. Her grandmother was a hoarder, her uncle smoked/sold crack and got several prescriptions for narcotics (which he also sold, this is in FL btw). Her mother was unemployed, lazy, and unbeknownst to everyone but me, was buying pills from her brother.Anyway. At this time I had been on more of a hiatus than usual from opiates, as my previous connect had gone to prison. I was heavy into RC's. Deep into a spice addiction (back then I think it was AM-2201 or something). Taking 2c-e/2c-i on average about every other day when I had it. I hadn't thought about opiates for a while.I'm gonna pick up the pace on this because I feel I'm being unnecessarily detailed, but I feel like the more I say, the better an idea you have of how thoroughly this shit fucked my life up. Plus I'm on adderall at the moment, and I'm sure you all know how it affects verbosity on the internet.SOIt wasn't a 3 months before I was using the money I was making in the RC business to buy dilaudid whenever I could. It was way more available to me than before but still not ALL the time. He ran out fairly quickly. Still had never experienced w/d at this point.Christmas 2011, the day I find out my girlfriend is pregnant. I was on vacation in NJ at the time when she called with the news. The week I was up there was the longest I'd gone without any drugs (including cigarettes) in years. I felt absolutely great (while it lasted).Fell right back into the routine after I got back to my girl's house. Same old shit. Started dealing with shadier people and getting deeper into opiates. Gaining a bit of a tolerance. Now I needed 12mg of dilaudid to get me where 8 usually did.In April of 2012, I was robbed/jumped. Won't go into too much detail but after I had been choked out by surprise I woke up on the ground with a broken nose, my eyebrow gashed open (hit the pavement i guess) and one of my front teeth missing. Covered in blood, I stumbled back to the house and sat in the bathroom for 15 minutes trying to think of how I would go upstairs and confront my girl about what had just happened. Ended up just going up there and saying \"try not to freak out, but...\"She started crying, we went to the hospital. I got stitches on my head and a prescription for oxycodone 5/325 because the tooth had broken at the root with the nerve exposed (painful as FUCK).Now I have to say, I was pretty pumped on adrenaline from immediately after it happened until we had arrived at the hospital. It could have been shock, adrenaline, or my tendency to dissociate from traumatic or painful experiences and treat everything with levity, but my girl remarked that I was being extremely cool about the whole thing in a weird way.Indeed I was, and looking back I think it is because I knew I would be prescribed painkillers at the hospital. I even remember not 5 minutes after I had regained consciousness and noticed my tooth missing that \"damn i'm definitely going to get some painkillers for this\".Between the script they gave me in the ER, and the probably 5 or 6 scripts I got before/after dental surgery to get the root removed, and attempt to put in an implant (which failed), I was consistently opiated for at least 1 months. Between refills is when I got the first hints of withdrawal. I didn't like it one bit. I knew my scripts were going to run out soon and had no idea what I would do when that time came, but I didn't think about it consciously because I was occupied trying to not feel sick.Alas, eventually they ran out and I had to resort back to buying from her uncle. This time I wasn't fucking around. I had a hunger for it like I had never known before. I was willing to go to any lengths to achieve the nihilistic nods and empty thoughts that I loved so much. I think you can guess where this is going. For the last month that I used Dilaudid, I adopted the IV route.It was the only way I could afford to get as high as I \"needed\" to get. Pill prices were through the roof, and at $20-25 for 8mg I simply had no choice. I wasn't good at IVing. I shook way too much and could never keep the needle in a vein. Half of the time I had her uncle do it for me.Mind you, my girl had no idea I was shooting. It was extremely difficult to hide, thus why that didn't last for long. One time she, 7 months pregnant, walked in on him injecting me. I did my whole bullshit about how it was stupid and I'd never do it again. The usual pillhead lies. I didn't mean it. I'd go back and do it again an hour later if I could.I don't know what caused me to decide to stop shooting/taking pills. I think there still was a shred of aspiration left in me that shone through during a psychedelic trip that made me want to start to get better. I got myself into a methadone clinic in July 2012. That's right, instead of dealing with a week, two weeks of w/d tops, I decided to get on a long-term maintenance program. That's because I didn't really want to quit. I had methadone once before and it got me higher than any other opiate I'd tried.$14 a day that shit cost me (and by me, i mean my mother). My girl and I moved in with my mother because she was due in August and I was \"trying to recover\" and there's no way in hell she would let her granddaughter be born and live in that fuck of a house.Gee, looking back on it I guess I took advantage of my daughter as a way to not get kicked out of my mom's house for bleeding her dry financially. Funny the things you realize with adderall and hindsight.Anyway, a tad but about the clinic and then I'll fast-forward:Upon entry, they start you on 30mg your first day. Next day you come in and tell them if you still had w/d symptoms and if so, they raise you 5mg. I did that every day with impunity until I reached 45mg.  I didn't need to go above 30. Shit I probably only needed 15 or 20. I was absolutely zonked all day on that shit.When I reached 45 I started getting out of hand with the sedation. Nodding off basically constantly. Unable to care for my newborn baby unassisted. Still, though, I felt the need to tell the doctor every week that I needed a 10mg increase (to which they obliged without question).In a matter of months I was up to 140mg. Eventually, as money wore thin, I started having anxiety about what would happen if my mother could not afford my methadone. I had read countless horror stories of methadone withdrawal even WITH a taper. I could not imagine how much worse the methadone w/d would be from 140mg cold turkey. This is when I decided I would start lowering my dose 5mg a week.So I did. Unfortunately, I had only gotten down to 100mg before we moved to NJ in July 2013. I was planning on setting up a transfer to a clinic up there, but I had procrastinated and was simply unable to do so. This was my stoke of luck. This is the reason I have not touched opiates since July 2013.A bit of a fast forward, from then till now:-we get to nj, i am in deep, deep w/d-i'd drink, steal benzos belonging to my uncle we're staying with, and take DXM to mask the symptoms-one day i was out of drugs to mask so i rationalized to cut my torso, arms and legs \"in order to force out endorphins\", (post-dxm binge w/d rationale, eh?)-after that incident my girlfriend took our daughter and moved out of state to live with her family-once i am able to walk and function normally i start walking through the woods looking for mushrooms both as a hobby and a way to distract myself. also it was extremely therapeutic and relaxing and I recommend this to anybody that is in w/d. the looking for mushrooms part helped a lot I think because it gave me a goal. a reason to scan my environment carefully and appreciate it all rather than walk around bored and alone.Mid-late September is when the acute withdrawal subsided. The constant chills/fever, sweats and cramps were behind me. Until November I suffered extreme IBS and the occasional chills/hot flashes. Oh and there was this weird thing where whenever I would start to eat, the under side of my jaw (kind of near my lymph nodes) would light up in sharp stinging pain. it would even happen in anticipation of eating as well.As of now, I have no recognizable lasting w/d symptoms (9-months later). I am extremely proud of myself for surviving cold-turkey methadone withdrawal and not even giving opiates a second thought. I now associate them with nothing but pain, misery, and death.Cost me my tooth, my intact nose, i won't even try to calculate how much money (most of it from my mom), my relationship, countless friendships, and most of all my daughter.I still struggle daily with motivation, self-confidence, and anxiety issues. These were always here before but I feel like they've festered and grown while I was in opiate land. I find it extremely stressful to interact and converse with people.I'm sorry about this mountain of text, as I'm sure nobody will be THAT interested to read the whole thing, but I feel a lot better after having just typed it out. It's really the first time I've taken the time to sit down, hash it all out and put it into perspective. Plus, perhaps somebody going through withdrawal from classical opiates will read this and realize that 2 weeks of withdrawal is nothing compared to 2-4 months and stick with it rather than getting on methadone.Really if I can save one person methadone I think my entire life would have had a significant purpose.Or maybe somebody is on or withdrawing from methadone and could use a reminder that if it's possible to cold turkey from 100mg daily, then it's possible to get off, period.If anybody has any questions or would just like some support of even a friendly chat, feel free to PM me.Much love, and good luck,ArmouredKittenP.S. if this is too long or inappropriate for this thread, let me know and I will start a new one for Opiate Success Stories or something like that.Last edited by ArmouredKitten; 03-04-2014 at.p.s.", "date": "03-04-2014", "time": "10:42", "datetime": 1396521720},

{"comment": "I have been taking 100mg morphines (cut to break the time release coating) for around 10 days in a row only in the evening...  I have been taking phentermine during the day. (  this is my first time ever even hearing about this drug, but I enjoy adderal to an extent and I prefer phentermine tbh! Which was very surprising after reading all the skaving reviews on this forum.) But I was wondering if I am only using the morphine at night instead of an all out week and a half bing fest is it possible I won't suffer wds? I do know that if I do an all out 2 week 30mg working up to multie 600 mg days I go through 5 days of WD... Not super horrible 5 yrs using  WD,  but a not very pleasant & literally shitty 5 days....My job is extremely physical & I get so positive about being able to just tough it up when the opiate well runs dry!!  I also have been trying  to.find an answer to this everywhere with no avail.I am guessing this is a long shot because they stay on your system 3 days yadda yadda.. I also read it is possible to go three days without any pills before the actual detoxing kicks in the withdrawal system. I had been completely dependant on prescribed methadone and upgraded to morphine for around 5 years before my doctor added Soma which caused me.to.OD twice and lose my job and insurance. Clean for a year and a recreational user for 2 years now.. I have gonr thru very acute withdrawals compared to kicking after 5 yrs. I do know I go 24 hours before WD sets in & it takes me 5 days to feel totally normal.I'm also a pretty consistent user,  but once every month or 2 I am able to get some super inexpensive 100mg and I cannot resist!! I try and keep my consistent usage to a week but the weekend comes and self control & I are mortal enemies.And if you are going to reply and know the answers to these bonus questions you would be doing me a real solid!!\"* does taking stimulants(adderall or phentermine) and opiates cause stress on the lungs and make it difficult to breath??[Or am I dying from  black mold]*is there any remedy that is better than the antiDhea pills to stop my intestines from spazzing during  WD and nonstop blackneon death. (This is the biggest problem during  these minor WD for me.)*last time I  have used too many and dsy for a few daystoo long I took norcos and sstill felt somewhat not the best but when I stopped the norcos I didn't have any wds!! How did that happen!??!* any restless leg while trying to sleep advice if I do get sick.* are the intestine / stomach.pain just from lack of going to the bathroom for the week or whatever that you binge?Last edited by corpsecircles; 25-05-2014 at.typos", "date": "25-05-2014", "time": "13:51", "datetime": 1401025860},

{"comment": "Restless legs: PREGABALIN bro. Absolutely a life saver and for Me, a 2-300mg dose takes all restlessness away. Many opiate addicts I know pay top dollar for these.this is how effective lyrica(pregabalin) is for opiate withdrawal:-Takes 80-90% of that horribly anguishing restlessness away.-Takes 75-90% of that crippling depression away.-Takes 50% of that horrible feeling of not being able to eat or drink away. Increases my hunger significantly.-Curbs around 25-30% of my rebound pain I experience during the overall pain sensitivity of opiate WD.It is honestly a high of its own (Schedule 5 in the U.S.) but tolerance develops rapidly so I only use it to combat opiate WD.My comfort kings areModerately high dose of Lyrica,Moderate dose of Loperamide.4-800mg of ibuprofen and around 10mg of my Rx'd Remeron to sleep.I'm also prescribed 350mg of Soma 2x a day which I swear by to thoroughly knock me out. For me they truly do the job better than benzos. Now, keep in mind I'm not giving you dosage advice here as it is against the rules. Also, Lyrica and Soma are both scheduled meds and more difficult to get prescribed. I would talk to a doctor about Neurontin, Lyricas weaker, unscheduled, but almost as effective little sister. Once the restlessness is cured, a sleep aid such as an antidepressant like Remeron, Trazadone, or Seroquel will help you sleep. UNTIL you can stay still with no restlessness, they will make it WORSE. DEAL with the restlessness first.If you don't find neurontin or lyrica effective, only a Benzo or a strong centrally acting muscle relaxer like Soma will help. I strongly advise avoiding these at all costs as they are very addictive drugs all on their own. Good luck buddy! Sounds like you have a relatively small habit.

{"comment": "Ok, your post is kinda sloppy, but I'll give it a shot.Normally, no, since you we're only using at night, you wouldn't get a physical dependence. 100mg MScontin(or equivalent) isn't much. But with a history of abuse addiction, it could be possible.But it would be like the lowest form of dependency. The withdrawal symptoms would be very mild.In your case, I think it's just \"rebound\" effects. Abusing any drug carries rebound, and it can be pretty damn pronounced with opiates. 100mg morphine still isn't a small dose, even after 10 nights you'll feel rough not taking it, but a couple days and your body adjusts.That also answers \"bonus question\" number 5, it is just a rebound effect, your intestines have been filled with opioids, not having them basically makes em' squirm for a few days(at those doses, heh)As for the Norco \"bonus question\", it explains that too. Your not truly \"dependent\", just experiencing rebound effects. Hydrocodone is less potent than morphine, switching to them is a kind of taper method, basically an easier transition.(Think of it this way: Patient A goes to ER, gets 15 Norco 7.5, he doesn't have any negative effects when he runs out. If Patient B recieves 10 OxyContin 160's, well, he'll feel pretty damn rough when he runs out)For bonus question 2: Not really, but first generation antihistamines(see below) will help, and 2nd gen's to a lesser extent, with higher doses.Bonus question 4: Don't worry, you won't have any.Bonus question 1: WTF? Black Mold???\ud83d\ude14(Footnote: A few 1st generation antihistamines: Benadryl Doxylamine, chorpherinamine, all over the counter.Cetirizine or loratadine work in a pinch, just double the recommended dose.)", "date": "26-05-2014", "time": "10:24", "datetime": 1401099840},

{"comment": "****PLEASE READ THIS****Hello all, first time posting but please read this. I just spent the last week going prepping for withdrawals for a 10 year opiate addiction (roughly 10-12 Perc-30s (roxios)daily along with subs, OC80's, opanas, tramadol's, etc. So after doing some research I was able to prep for my terrible week of withdrawals. I was equipped with roughly everything (DXM, benzos, lope, Kratom, vitamins, bananas, etc). I left and went very far away from anywhere I could get access to anything. Little did I know I wouldn't need nearly any of these things besides DXM. It literally took away every withdrawal feeling I had. I had absolutely no RLS, in fact I slept like a baby. I think the biggest mistake people make with DXM is the significant amount that they take. It's completely unnecessary. I took roughly double possibly triple the dose but no one where near any of the robotrips. Please I beg you to try this. Buy Nyquil too, because it also has DXM.My process started with me taking 8 lopamide pills the first 2 days (but absolutely do not exceed this ) because its extremely addictive. I took a benzo occasionally but because of the DXM it literally never gave me RLS. So 2 days of lope, and 4 or 5 small amount of DXM for 3-4 days and its over. I have been through the worst withdrawals to the point I wanted to die. I couldn't sleep and the RLS was a nightmare. And with DXM I did not have any of these side effects. If you really want to quite then please please try this means. You will not need the kratom, very little benzos, and only 2 days of lope for the first 2 days. These steps will rid you of sleeplessness, RLS, the runs, and all of the other excruciating things that go with it. It's been over a week, and I haven't taken a single thing in days and I feel better than ever! I really didn't know this was possible. just had to share this with someone. Thanks!

{"comment": "I have been completely strung out on Fentanyl 100mcg/hr patches (sometimes wearing two at once for weeks on end. Or I would take approximately 300mg oxy instant release (10 or so of the 30 mg pills.. snorting and eating them like tic tacs). Sometimes I would take both. Just laying that out to establish I'm speaking from experience.I believe I am an expert at withdrawals because I have scheduled a week off and went cold turkey at least a dozen times with success. And by success I mean I had stopped everything for well over a month and was at the point where I had no cravings or wasn't uncomfortable at all.Unless you have really hit it hard and quit over and over like me, you might be surprised at how easy it is.  I stopped cold turkey the first few times and life sucked the first three but on day 4-5 it was like a cloud was lifted and I was completely fine. And mind you, I had been flying high off fent, which is no joke. These last few times though, it's taken more like a week. I really feel that many of you will be completely fine in a week. So remember that. Literally every second, you a second closer to victory. And after day 3, literally every second after the next is easier than the one before it.I've tried everything you can think of to help and here is what I found best. I am only including he things that I think really had an impact.Eat super healthy... starting before you quit. Lots of green stuff, fruit vegetables, etc.Do NOT eat any processed foods.Do NOT drink alcohol.... tried this, makes it much worse.-I list those three things above and they all basically make you what's called 'alkaline'. It is very hard for diseases to exist in an alkaline body. Go look up alkalinity and being 'alkaline' is your goal. If you have a juicer - juice the shit out of kale and dark green leafy stuff. But you don't need a juicer. Just look up what items are high in alkaline and avoid the ones high in acid. That is why booze is sooo bad for w/d = super high in acid.*Potassium - banannas or supplements - it helps.*Tyrosil - I might be getting the name wrong. This nutrient helps.Check out the 'Thomas Recipe\"Elimidrol - it helps. It just basically has a ton of the tyrosil, B6, potassium, zinc and other stuff people recommend.All the other stuff people recommend for RLS or Diahherea. Inexplicably, I get neither of those when I w/d.And here is my BEST advice you don't see much of, but it works if you can wrap your head around it: Thoughts = Images = Feelings = Behavior.Alot of what we feel and experience is based on three things: Our phsiology (what we are doing with out bodies), our language, and our focus (the pictures we have in our head).If you don't believe this then stretch your arms out, look up at the sky, smile real big - and then feel bad. You can't. What we are doing with our bodies affects how we feel. This is why I highly recommend you go for the walks or exercise as people suggest.*Focus is the most important though. I can't stress this one enough. It's very hard but try to put images in your head of when you were at an absolute peak state (not on drugs) and doing really well. Keep repeating that image in your head. Everytime that 'tinge' for drugs pops in your head get mad at it. Try to make even the thought make you angry and sickened by it. You don't do that crap anymore, you are a champion!And quit researching how to feel better and obsessing over it. You need to change your thoughts.I can't stress this enough, if you wrap your head around it: Thoughts = Images = Feelings = Behavior. It's like a recipe. Change one element of this recipe and the end result changes. This can be studied in depth by researching \"neuro linquistic programming\" or \"NLP\".Be well!", "date": "04-06-2014", "time": "21:05", "datetime": 1401915900},

This is my family doc of many years.Fast forward three years later, I went to a walking clinic because my doctor was on vacation and I couldn't get an appointment for another two weeks. I brought my empty bottles and the doc could see I was in pain. I told him to call my doc's office whatever he needed. He filled my script and I will never forget what he told me on my way out: \"be careful...take this stuff for a week straight and you're going to have serious issues\".A complete stranger of a doctor gave me more warning than my family doc of 35 years.the funniest part though was when he told me: \"I can't have that stuff around me, I love it too much, makes you feel awake and great\". Got me thinkin' if he had been through the dance himself one time or more!", "date": "12-06-2014", "time": "04:11", "datetime": 1402546260},

{"comment": "sounds like you will reset your withdrawls back to the beginning so you have to start all over any time you had in sober is wasted now im afraid once you did that rush of opiates it put your body right back to the way it was before you started detoxing. you will have to suffer day one day two and 3 again keep in mind next time you want to relapse that you will be put in the same pit of despair you were in previously despite how much clean time you have achieved.I have a friend who  was clean from opiates for 20 years then he decided to get high one day and in a day or 2 he was as strung out and hooked to the dope as he was 20 years prior despite having 20 years clean. opiate addicts cant go back to using causally once addicted it stays in thier brain for life so every time an addict trys to use opiates responsibly after putting in some sober time they usually end up digging themselves into the same hole they were in during their worst point of addiction.", "date": "13-06-2014", "time": "06:28", "datetime": 1402640880},

{"comment": "First time posting hereK... So I've been on pharmaceutical morphine (iv) for almost 1.5 years. My daily dosage during the last six months was around 600mg per day - sometimes more. Didn't taper anything down, in fact, I even stepped it up during the last weeks of usage (up to 1000mg) before going cold.Anyway, now \"clean\" for 9 days, right now I'm dealing with PAWS, but it aint that bad. The \"worst\" days were day 2 and 3, on the 4th day I felt better already, after day six I had no withdrawal symptoms anymore.No vomiting (thank God), no diarrhea.Before I started I've been so sure that I'll be the lucky one getting all the symptoms (thinking of my daily dosage) but nope. Instead, just:Sleeplessness, RLS, hot/cold and sweating.I had Lyrica (RLS), some Benzos and Weed - of course.Fuck me, this was my easiest withdrawal ever. Why is it that it's so easy for me whilst for others it's pure hell (even with lower daily dosages)?Anyway, thanks to this thread here I found Lyrica which was my biggest little helper. This stuff is pure gold when it comes to RLS, thanks for that!Edit: I went through withdrawals from heroin some years ago, but back then I was only smoking it.

{"comment": "I took 60 mg or so of hydrocodone for about a couple of weeks and and am experiencing withdrawals. Not like I am going to die but uncomfortable enough. My last does was 30 mg yesterday and I have not today. I took some 5 Fiorocet which obviously doesn't seem to help much with the withdrawals (I thought I would take it because it is not an opitate), 1.5 kolonopins, and 10mg of flexiril. I also took 800 mg of ibuprofen this morning and 500 mg of tylenol. The Fiorocet has 325mg of tylenol per pill so yes, I jacked up on the Tylenol, yes my liver does not like it. But I was hoping it was going to help a little with the aches and pains. I know this withdrawal is considered mild when compared to other people who have been on higher doses on a longer duration but it still feels completely terrible. Muscle aches, cramps, nausea, sweats, the obvious bathroom issues, inability to sleep, etc. I can't imagine it would last more than a day or two. My last dose of hydrocodone was about 35 mg yesterday because that is all I had left. Probably should start feeling better tomorrow or will tomorrow will be the worst before I feel better on day 3...any advise? I know this is no 120-240mg of hydrocodone or percocet of months or years as unfortunately some have endured but bottom line the withdrawals still sucks and it is there so any advice on duration for something that feels terrible but with the anticipation of it being mild length of withdrawal?

{"comment": "Sorry if this is not in the right forum but I am new here and couldn't find in the guidelines where to post this, anyway here I go and any help is greatly appreciated.I am 27 years old and am addicted to heroin. I first tried the drug in high school but it was never a problem until about 2 years ago when I started using daily. I started just messing around once in awhile with it and then before I knew it I was using almost everyday, it has been almost 2 years since the addiction took hold. I am no longer myself, while others may not yet notice any changes in me I DO. I am so sick of living this way. No one except one really close friend knows what I am going through and living this double life is starting to mess with my mental health. I have seen this drug ruin a couple of close friends lives and I am dumbfounded that I didn't learn from their mistakes. I work a full time job mon-fri and pay all my bills so from the outside it may not look as though anything is wrong but they would be wrong.  I use to always be out with friends, I was involved in sports which I loved and now I work and I stay home doing nothing but getting high and I am tired of it. I got clean once before in which I didn't use for 7 days and felt great but I started up again. It was the way I felt after those 7 days that I really really want to get back to feeling. I felt things that I hadn't felt in months maybe a year. I felt life! I miss that feeling and am really looking to get back to being sober and experiencing life again. Today my close friend said he can get us suboxone this weekend and those words could not have come at a better time as I feel like going on as I have been is a path that I can not carry along much longer. I know if I can get clean this time I can make it last. My question is how many suboxone pills should I get to ween myself off the H. I am 6'3 300lbs and for the last 2 years have been doing about 3 dubs of dope a day via snorting. I asked for 10 pills for sure and I believe they are of the 8mg variety. I know I must start to W/D from the H before I take any of the suboxone but are the 10 pills enough for me and if not how many should I try and get and how should I break them up for use and for how many days. Please any help you can offer on this would be greatly appreciated. I always believed it was mind over matter with addiction but that was before I got addicted to dope. If I could just lay in bed for a week I could just take the pain but that is not an option at this point.", "date": "05-07-2014", "time": "09:57", "datetime": 1404554220},

{"comment": "Hey man read your story that sounds pretty common or heroin addicts we always think its not gonna happen to me or I can control it. We make excuses for why we don't have a problem such as I don't steal like typical junkies, I work for my drugs, or I could stop if I really had to but that's all they are are excuses  and things you say to justify your continuing drug use to make YOU feel better in your mind.I remember my first opiate was one single percocet and I felt like I could do anything once the narcotic hit my bloodstream I knew right away I was in for a world of shit. I was right the pills led me to heroin which felt even better and  got me more addicted than I could have ever imagined. Almost ten years later I'm still chasing this high to the gates of insanity Suboxone saved me for now but it only covers up this sickness that lies within me the problem is still there. I've seen so many good hard working people succumb to heroin addiction and are left worthless zombies going through the motions hustle get money get dope get high then repeat they lose family's jobs, entire businesses even putting their family on the streets and still they cannot stop their obsession with this drug.  I hardly see any good in the dope game it has brought me a lot of pain and hurt taken away my dreams for the future, damaged my body and most of all taken away my zest for life. But there is a reason we continue using despite all the pain and hurt it seems to bring us like the quote from the movie trainspotting\"People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored, but what they forget is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not fucking stupid. At least, we're not that fucking stupid.\"But that's so great to hear your gonna try to beat this remember the hard part is staying off once your detoxed, the detox will be fairly easy if you follow my instructions on tapering closely and don't take the sub for too long. With the subs you got If you have 8mg pills then that 10 should be plenty but you may want to find out for sure but if they are 2mg you could just buy  30 pills or whatever you can cause its the same thing but 10-2mgs wouldn't be enough unless you can get by on 2mgs a day but chances are youll need more  . What I would do is get the pills to keep safe then finish all your dope I wouldn't get anymore than 10 I mean 5 8s would be fineeven cause the longer you drag the taper out the harder it is to jump you start becoming addicted to the sub itself which will make things a real bitch.Ive done many rapid sub detoxes and they work better than slow drawn out month long tapers EXCEPT if the person has been taking suboxone daily for a long time like 3+ months for a suboxone matainance program or whatever. If your going straight from heroin to a sub taper and don't want to take the same dose of sub daily for years then tapering quickly is your best bet to not prolong withdrawls and make the detox at the end easier on youFirst once you finish your dope wait till you get really sick this could take anywhere from 6-48 hours depending on your metabolism so don't go by the amount of time someone else waited to induct go by what YOUR body is telling you.Once you feel sick physically and you just want some relief cause your stomachs acting up/cold sweats happening then that's the time to take the sub if you take it sooner well you already know whats gonna happen then im guessing.Start with 2mgs under the tounge then see how that feels then if that doesn't work do another 2mgs see how that works and you may need 8mgs a day but im thinking 4-6mgs would work but its important to start small and work your way up so you don't get anymore dependant on opiates then you already were and it also greatly reduces the chances of going into precipitated withdrawal but if you do go into precipitated withdrawl then the lower dose of sub you took the less severe the PWs will be.say you started on 8mgs a good taper would be-Day 1: 8mgs-Day 2: 8mgs-Day 3:6mgs-Day 4:4mgs-Day 5:3mgs-Day 6:2mgs-Day 7:1mgs-Day 8: 0.5mgs-Day 9: 0.25mgs-Day 10:Nothing-Day 11:0.25mgs-Day 12:Nothing-Day 13:0.125 (or100 micrograms is close enough)-Day 14: freedom!!!If you follow this same taper you will only have slight very minor symptoms that wont need to be medicated only for  a few days then you got to figute out a way to stay off the drugs and if you keep relapsing and using dope putting yourself in the same pit of despair over and over and constantly having to detox then you may want to think about going on a suboxone program to stabilize and get your life in order but try this detox and get a support system in place fro after detox or even during as you wont feel bad while on the sub you will feel no symptoms during the taper so going to AA or NA or seeing a drug counsler is possible and recommended during the taper and after to help you find ways to keep clean.good luck my friend I wish you all the best in this battle to take back your life and truly hope you succeed if you ever want to talk im here just  private Message me whenever man and any questions on tapering or about subs/detoxing just give me a shout", "date": "05-07-2014", "time": "19:33", "datetime": 1404588780},

{"comment": "Hoping this is the right thread for this post, searched around a bit and couldnt find it so i guess it hasnt been brought up yet...As everyone whos been opiate/opiod dependent knows, right before you are about to start W/D and during it, you buy a bunch of otc withdrawal remedies, try to hustle your doctor for clonidine, benzos, ambien etc., you search the internet and post on forums for ways to stop or ease the W/D symptoms. While taking a bunch of herbs, otc meds, perscription drugs etc., you are just treating yourself like a guinea pig. Excessive use of OTC meds/herbs/remedies can even make your symptoms worse. Example#1:IME like most others, taking alot of benadryl to try to sleep makes insomnia, RLS, blood pressure/heart rate worse. Example#2: I respond very well to Clonidine. It lowers my heart rate/blood pressure which in turn eases RLS, Anxiety and helps me fall asleep.  Every withdrawal is different than the first time. There is no \"building a tolerance\" to withdrawal.  The guessing game gets old real quick as to which things will help you and that can even change as well.So what i want to throw out there is What about DNA/Genetic analyzation? There is this DNA analyzation kit out there now called \"23 and me\". It goes for around $100. You provide a saliva sample and the company posts all kinds of information about you (that only you can see obviously) online including but not limited to; genetic disorders, inheritted traits, complications, drug responses etc. etc. I wonder if this can eventually lead to you knowing exactly what to take to successfully combat withdrawal symptoms.Alot of the W/D symptoms are caused by out of proportion levels of vitamins,minerals and chemicals in the body. Knowing what your body will respond to would give you the upper hand and put an end to the frustrating guessing game we all play.Also, it may seem like I am contradicting myself with \"Every withdrawal is different\" and \"knowing what your body will respond to\". Im kind of on the line with it myself but im pretty damn sure it takes alot more than a moderate term opiate/opiod dependency or addiction to mutate your DNA. Maybe after long term usage of opiates/opiods on a consistent basis can mutate DNA but I personally believe this is not true for short to moderate term opiate/opiod dependency/addiction.Lastly, I have never used the \"23 and me\" product or anything of such nature for that matter. I have done some research on the product and have developed a theory, that's all. As before mentioned, I believe it could be (with alot more research) a surefire way to curb withdrawal symptoms.If anyone has used \"23 and me\" please chime in and shed some light on this for us.

{"comment": "First of all, where did the original questioner state that he did not get high? He said he did less than he usually does but he did not state that he did not get high and that also does not mean he didn't get high.Second of all, trainspotter has spoken enough about himself and his history (500mg oxy > 8-ball of heroin a day and now he is on subs) so he doesn't need to hide anything so your second mistake is assuming he was talking about himself....you're not exactly oozing confidence here. And what if on the fourth day he realizes that \"you know what, those two bags werent bad and I feel ok so I'll just get another two bags...\" then maybe three, then maybe six and then maybe another 6-day IV binge before reality hits?What's next - go cop an 8-ball of heroin and try to IV taper?", "date": "10-07-2014", "time": "13:42", "datetime": 1404999720},
{"comment": "I did not assume that trainspotter was speaking about himself.  that's the one of the reasons why i wrote that post.  I see in the second paragraph I did make a typo, sorry.I am saying this to trainspotter is because he says after 2 bags of heroin, 3 days into withdrawal, all the withdrawal will restart and it will be just as bad as he first was withdrawing off the 6 bags a day.If you take a small dose right after a week long binge while your in withdrawal will just relieve your withdrawals for a long time and not get you high enough to make a difference.its in effect the same method as tapering... you use less of the drug so your withdrawal isn't as bad...I can believe if he has a history, and he feels full withdrawals after doing the same thing the 'original questioner' did.everyone reacts to drugs differently.I am speaking about my own personal experience and the experience of people around me and what i've read about other people's experiences.2 bags on day 3 after a 6 a day week long binge you will have less withdrawal when originally taking the drug.for me it feels like i start day 3 withdrawals over again. I'm just not nearly as sick.  I feel a lot better especially because sometimes i even get some sleep.I am not an advocate of taking A LITTLE HEROIN during withdrawal.  It makes me want more heroin BECAUSE I'm NOT high.I usually use a quick taper of suboxone over the course of 1.5-2weeks after a week long binge.there's virtually no withdrawals from that.", "date": "10-07-2014", "time": "14:20", "datetime": 1405002000},
{"comment": "You can believe what you want we have freedom of speech here but in no way is going back to just a little bit of dope during detox fine. Your playing with fire yes your right some people can do that then get back on track but most will reset their withdrawal totally by doing that kind of stuff I do know what I'm talking about here if an addict is in detox and they are in day 2-3 of withdrawal then decide to flood their opiate receptors again obviously its gonna make you feel better at first but then you worse off after that cause now you have to let the opiates you just did leave your body all over after your were almost over the very worst of withdrawal.I think your just looking to act like a big shot I don't know where you get your info from I volunteer in the local detox down where I live and am studying to have the qualifications to work in there permanently I spend a lot of time in there and have been in detoxing myself 7 times. Weve seen it in detox many times a user detoxes  after 5-7 days in there then leaves decides I'll use a little bit to go to sleep then they wake up sick and their brain is screaming to use again.

{"comment": "I understand the addict mindset of rationalizing using a \"tiny bit\" to sleep... To eat... To find a bit if relief . But it completely contradicts the TRUE goal. Why play with the fire. I know that even 1mg of methadone may make me feel a bit better...give an inch take a foot. I DON'T want to revisit any aches, pains, all that IS withdrawal... Be it my first time or this time. One of the big problems with this aid as WELL, playing into the addicts mind. To go ahead and take a little! Unless serious to make a change , you will find no resolve. That meaning not just changing the world around you, but also, even more so, the world within you.As for trainspotter (and many here) but speaking of trainspotter...don't put him in any kind if box or say what you don't truly know of. He's helped many and will continue to do so...he knows addiction knows withdrawal . There are crucial moves to make and NOT make while going through a taper, detox & withdrawal.. and sound advise- don't look backwards once you've taken 3steps forward .  It seems to me that (perhaps) a lot of attempted detox are unaccomplished due to  \"one hit\"... Who knows where that one hit will take you. It's fucking hard to beat it...as we all know . Lastly, to say  \"don't make the same mistake trainspotter did... \" kindly, piss off. Find another way to  make your  \" point \".", "date": "10-07-2014", "time": "20:28", "datetime": 1405024080},

{"comment": "I used kratom extracts daily for years and quit no problem.  It was kinda like quitting coffee, very tired, didn't want to work, didnt give a shit, but ephedrine and a caffeine helped me through days, with etizolam every other night with pretty much no side effects, and all \"withdrawal\" gone in 5 days.Then I got into tramadol for 3 months.  I was up to minimum of 300mg a day.  Went on a bender where I did about 800mg per day, for 7 straight days, along with etizolam to raise my seizure threshold so I could keep chasing the high.  When I quit I contemplated suicide.  It was the worst I ever felt.  The derealization was insane.  I didn't know what I was, who I was, or where I was.  I felt like life was an illusion.  Terrible brain zaps, auditory hallucination, no appetite, and my vision was fucked up for a long time.It's funny because now I'll go on 5-7 days oxy binges where I'll do only maybe 30-80mg of oxy in a day depending on how much spare cash I have.  The withdrawal isn't too terrible, but I guess because my first taste of withdrawal was so bad, I usually get through them no problem with a few teaspoons of kratom a day.  I feel like no withdrawal can ever touch my tramadol withdrawal except for large methadone dose withdrawal, or large dose benzo withdrawal.  Mid range opiate withdrawals are nothing to me now, I get over them quickly, and with no problem.  People at work can't tell I'm sick, neither can my family.I warn anyone who uses tramadol about slowly weaning off and not cold turkeying.  If there is a hell, tramadol withdrawal is what it feels like.  I read somewhere that tramadol affects Opioid, Gaba, Serotonin, Dopamine, Norepinphrine, and a few other chemicals/receptors in your brain so its like coming off multiple drugs at once.  The minor relaxation from tramadol is not worth the withdrawal, that I've heard can last up to 6 months (mine was about 2 weeks).  Doctors need to stop handing these things out like candy, many of the doctors and shrinks i've been to still believe tramadol is non-addictive.

{"comment": "(Backstory)So for over the last 3 years i have heavily abused opiates. It started in 2011 with Norco 10. Then Percocet 10. Then Roxy 15. Then Roxy 30. Then eventually Oxy 80. But soon after, around 2012 i graduated to Heroin (after running out of pills, unable to let withdrawal interrupt my life, and Heroin being all i could find) Snorting the poison everyday for almost 2 years. At first i worked a \"paid in cash daily\" job so i never had to settle for hustling or stealing. But this past June my tolerance went to complete shit and i was literally in need of a line every 4 hours or i started getting chills and stomach churns. With a pocket full of dope and cash i realized i couldnt keep living like this. And after seeing literally every person i know on Suboxone and Methadone struggling just as bad as i wasjust prolonging, and prolonging. I decided i was gonna do this shit cold turkey.(Discovering/Receiving the Kratom)3 hours after my last fix i was surfing the web reading others stories about cold turkey when i came across an article about Kratom. Super curious. I thought why not and ordered some to be shipped to me the following day. When i woke up (got out of bed. like i was really sleeping! ha!) i was sweating. Cramping. Chills. Puking. Using what little energy i had to run back and forth to the bathroom. Butt exploding. I couldnt move but at the same time i couldnt sit still. Nose pouring snot. Mouth over producing saliva. Terrible disgusting nasty taste that wouldnt leave my mouth. I literally had one emotion: Suicidal Depression.2:24pm came with a ring of the doorbell. I literally tippy toed to the door from lack of energy. I opened the door. Grabbed the package and went straight to the kitchen. The website where i discovered using Kratom for withdrawal explained to get Red Vein Borneo. And to consume 2 teaspoons with each dose. But the vendor also sent an extra 50g of samples to make the weight of the package proper (This was a god send because i didnt realize it would take about 120grams to fully complete the 7 day Kratom plan)I quickly washed down the 2 teaspoons with grape fruit juice and crawled back upstairs and threw myself back into bed. Exhausted from that little but of movement. I fell asleep. I abruptly woke up 22 minutes later with a warm feeling throughout my entire body. Very similar (but honestly absolutely nowhere near) opiate warmth. I sat up. Sweat gone. Legs comfortable. Stomach settled. Nausea non existent. I felt like a 100% completely normal human being. I grabbed my cigarettes and went for a walk outside chain smoking (not from the Kratom giving me a buzz but just because i could tolerate the taste of smoke again) Everything was alright. I was a human again. I continued the detailed Kratom plan i saw on the internet and 7 days later took my last dose. That was 29 days ago. I am still 100% completely fine and normal. Kratom was a god sendA few things id like to make clear about my Kratom experience. I absolutely receivedhigh or buzz of off Kratom. It literally just depleted any and all symptoms of the Heroin withdrawal. Sometimes i would feel like it gave me an energy boost. But not everytime so this may have been placebo. But i do know that this was honestly a miracle for someone like me, who felt stuck in a cycle with no help other than other addicting drugs like methadone or suboxone. In order for this stuff to truly work you have to. You have to honestly not want the drug anymore. If you go into this just not wanting a sickness anymore you'll just be prolonging the inevitable. If you have any questions regarding vendors, the website i found the Kratom plan and what that plan entails, or prices and would like my opinion just shoot me a private message.I am currently 46 days clean of any and all opiates. 29 days with no Kratom use. I have recently helped two friends with my left over kratom and one is 21 days clean and the other is 15 days clean. So this works. Never doubt anyone who says different.

{"comment": "I am addicted to pain pills of many sorts. My question is, how long before I feel withdrawal symptoms. It's been exactly 28 days since I've taken any pain meds. However, in a last ditch effort to kick the habit, I went to a clinic that started me on Methadone Therapy. Exactly 9 days ago was the last time I went to the clinic because after doing research on Methadone it scared the shit out of me. I was on 70mg every day of the Methadone. I've been expecting torturous withdrawal symptoms but I can't say that I've experienced any yet. Now before anyone cusses me out because they have had a hell of a time and I haven't YET, let me tell you a couple medical conditions I currently have. I had a full hysterectomy on 4/8/14 and as a result it threw me into FULL menopause at the age of 31 (FML) and I also have a bad case of hypothyroidism which means my thyroid doesn't work. They say your thyroid levels shouldn't ever be above a 2.5, but from what I understand, as long as it's not above a 4.0 then you should be fine. Mine is a 7.2 which means it is worse than not working properly!!! I'm being treated for both of those conditions currently. On a daily basis I suffer from high anxiety, hot and cold flashes and digestion problems so I'm not sure if I have already gone through FULL withdrawals or not. If I haven't, what is it that I should expect to experience? And I guess it's also important for me to mention I've been doing the pain pill thing since April of 2013 when I shattered my ankle and had to get a titanium one put in place of my natural one. I started taking just the meds the doc gave me and it got worse from there. Any help/advise would be greatly appreciated!", "date": "15-08-2014", "time": "22:48", "datetime": 1408142880},

{"comment": "Just as a tip, it's most helpful to read this thread, stock up a supply of the most common themed remedies, and get familiar with the process BEFORE you actually have to experience WD's especially for the first time. It's so hard to concentrate or retain new information going into or through WD's, that the more prepared you are before you go through it, the better off you will be. My favorite WD aid, if you can get your Dr to Rx it, is Lomotil. It's got atropine in it, and I find that a couple of those stop the runny nose and watery eyes, the cold sweats, the diarrhea, basically improves everything but the aches and pains part. An since it is an opiate itself that crosses the BBB a little more readily that Lopriamide does, it does stick to a few receptors. My WD \"kit\" is a supply of gabapentin, xanax, lomotil, Zofran (for nausea and vomiting) seriquel (for sleep), Motrin, and D and B vitamins. I've been lucky in never getting RLS so idk what would help with that as I've never had to treat it.

{"comment": "I was taking oxycodone and methadone and gabapentin daily for 3 years. I was up to 240 mg oxy and 40 mg methadone and 2700 mg of gabapentin for in the final year. In January I made my second attempt to quit. I'm not a good taperer, and don't like to prolong the inevitable, so I quit cold turkey. I was armed with clonidine, promethazine, and diphenhydramine from my primary, but had moved away and had no medical supervision. I resigned myself to let the withdrawal take me where it would, and it took me to hell. I was willing to go through whatever it took to get free. I read all of your stories faithfully. You gave me strength and hope that I found nowhere else, so I want to give back. I am 7 months opiate free, and I have my life back. It took 2 days for WD to come. I was violently ill, sleep deprived, and filled with terror for over a month. However, on day 4, all if the pain for which I was being treated disappeared. Even the sensitivity in my teeth was gone. I had night sweats for months. I still have fatigue and my patience is low, which is difficult with 3 little kids. Like many others, I am here to say it's possible, and I want to lend my support in any way I can. It is a horrific life to be a slave.

{"comment": "I'm a 44 year old female and I have been on pain med for about 10 years, the last 5 on a consistent basis.  I do take them for pain related issues, in other words I haven't used them to recreationally get high and I have never taken them any other way than swallowing them in pill form.  I would say on an average I take about 50 to 70 mg's daily, 50 mg of the stronger meds and 70 of the other. The very reason I began taking them, to ease my pain and be able to get on with daily functions has now turned in to being wiped out or feeling \"blah\" and not wanting to do anything.  And don't get me wrong, I am aware of the euphoric feeling as well as it easing my pain away.  But I have become so dependent on them and I want to get off them and regain my life back.  But I am extremely afraid of the withdrawals.  I don't really know what to expect and for how long.  I know it's different for everyone, but I keep freaking myself out that I'm going to be soooooo sick and near death and that it's going to last forever.  Can anyone chime in and give me some advice or your experiences with withdrawing?  If there's anything I can buy OTC that will help with the symptoms and what got you through it.  I would greatly appreciate it.  I do have at my disposal at the  moment 15 Tramadols, 10 or so 2 mg Valium, diarrhea pills and Ibuprofen, Naproxen.

Any b vitamins will help too. None of this will be anything near painless. You've been on meds for a long time so it's gonna be brutal but since it's your first time detoxing then the acute symptoms will only last 3-5 days. Better to tough it out and never go back if that's possible. I'm a pain patient on a similar dose as well so in wondering what are you going to do to treat your pain? Anyway I wish u all the best. If you go back on the opiates after getting clean it'll be twice as hard, the wd will be much worse so be sure this is the end of it or next time u may not be able to stand the wd symptoms!If u find that it's too hard to quit then suboxone is always an option, u don't get the euphoria but u won't get sick...

{"comment": "Hi Movingon,I don't know about withdrawals from hydrocodone. The only thing I can think of is that if you're not feeling the \"climax\" of bad withdrawals by now, then you may not ever. This may be your only withdrawal 'moments'. Now, you mentioned you're taking Neurontin. Well, I'm taking it right now too. I've been taking Tramadol for about 7 yrs and I never knew it was addicting...of course, it just now became a \"controlled substance\" after they realized so many people were getting addicted to it like me! Well, I got up to the point of taking 4-5 50 mg of Tramadol about 10 times a day...that's a lot! It should have caused me to have seizures. Well, I'm now taken Gabapentin (generic Neurontin) and I too, just like you, am having a Low stage of withdrawals. I've had withdrawals from Tramadol and it's the most hallasious  feeling in the world and makes you want to just die...Well, the Gaba (Neurontin) is actually helping. I do feel like I'm running a fever, and feel a little 'tipsy' but I don't feel that awful, anxiety of paranoia and feelings of wanting to die....However, this is the first time I've not had the tramadol and am taking a new drug such as this Gaba so I don't know if my withdrawals will get worse or maintain in this stage. I'm terrified, too...I have twins and school and I can't handle withdrawals; they make me feel suicidal. I guess my point for responding to you is to tell you that if you haven't gone through the worst of the worst with your withdrawals, I don't think you will but I'm no doctor; I'm just a psychology student. I have done a lot of research on Neurontin (Gabapentin) and it seems to help many, many people with withdrawals. Every BODY is different, so I couldn't tell you what your future holds with withdrawals. I think you've had enough time for the worst to happen. I've only gone through 24 hours of no tramadol and I don't know what to expect. I'm TERRIFIED....Do you know anything about my situation?

{"comment": "Hello all! This is my very first post on Bluelight!I have been taking tramadol since I was 12 (got it for migraines) and I am 20 now. My dose has really gotten out of control! I started with ultracet pills which was only around 30mg of tramadol per pill plus some apap. I would take 2 of these at a time and get completely wrecked. However now I use pure tramadol IR or ER pills, up to 1200mg a day on the IR and for the 300mg ER pills (which I am now taking) I would take about 5 or 6 throughout the day. I know this is well above the seizure limit and I admit that I was stupid for this. Its really hard to control myself since I am addicted as well as suffering from severe fibromyalgia, hemiplegic migraines, and cluster headaches.Tramadol isn't the only thing I have been on though. I have been on hydrocodone binges for around a month at a time, this happened around 10 times over the last 2 years. It was when I used my prescription up way to early and went through withdrawal. This was up to 80mg a day. I do have experience with hydromorphone too but only up to 12mg oral.Now I am completely done with narcotics and I want to get my life back on track and manage my conditions without the use of painkillers. I took my last ER tramadol pill around 10 hours ago, so i have 14 hours left before it wears off. I have quite a stash of medications that may be useful for the horrible tramadol withdrawal and I am wondering what I should take, when to take it, and what dose.

{"comment": "This is my first time posting on bluelight. And although my join date is recent, I have searched bluelight for a few years to help with my opiate use. I have been on opiates for 5 years now. Fentanyl patch 75mcg every 3 days and Percocet 10/325's @ 4 p/day. Though my perc's are gone within a week and I supplement that with wearing 2 patches at a time on occasion. I go to a pain clinic. I was recently discharged without my knowledge. I found out when it was time for my next appt. So I am now without ANY opiates. I am not only dependant, I am a true addict. (obviously) ANYWAY, I just wanted to post how much loperimide has made a difference in my withdrawls!!!!!!! The anxiety, insomnia and diarrhea are the worst for me. I can not sit or lay down at all when I am withdrawing. With the loperimide (and tagament) I can function almost normally! The only problem is the constipation and dehydration. So I am taking a stool softener and drinking lots of hydrating fluids. I can not stress how much loperimide is a life saver! And you can get it OTC. I have ordered some red vein kratom and I am VERY anxious to try it in lieu of my regular opiates. If anyone can give me any advice as to the amount and how often I should use it, considering my past opiate use, I would be very thankful. I purchased the red vein kratom capsules. I'm not looking to get high, well maybe a slight warm, numb feeling, but mainly to maintain and to not crave my patch and pills.Last edited by Candy1969; 30-09-2014 at.", "date": "28-09-2014", "time": "21:32", "datetime": 1411939920},

A bit of pain can be a good thing in these circumstances anyway as it may remind you that you are probably never going to be able to use heroin occasionally so you either need to stop altogether or get on and enjoy yourself without worrying about it.

I was on 150-210mg Hydrocodone + 2 OxyContin 80mg + 40-60mg IR Oxycodone per day, for a couple years now. Before that I was on Suboxone until an injury put me back on painkillers. And before the Suboxone, I was on hydro+oxy for another injury in 2005.  I'm presently on vacation, and since the painkillers aren't doing crap anymore and I was spending 1000's per month on pain meds over what I was prescribed, I decided to quit completely, no long term sub this time. About 3 weeks before I quit, I switched to MS Contin, I bought a bunch of 60's and went from 6 per day to 3 per day over 3 weeks. I also bought 10 2mg Suboxone. When I ran out of MS Contin, the following morning I took 4mg Sub plus 60mg VYVANSE plus 0.1mg clonidine, then 2mg Sub at night. I was just fine. The next day I took 2mg Sub plus 60mg VYVANSE plus clonidine & 10mg loperamide upon waking up. I was just fine all day, a little exhausted, but nothing to complain about. At night I took 1mg sub plus clonidine & Benadryl and slept pretty good. Day 3 I took 1mg Sub and 60mg VYVANSE plus clonidine and 12mg loperamide and was fine all day.  Clonidine and Benadryl at night and I slept ok. Day 4....NO SUB, 60mg VYVANSE and clonidine as needed all day. Definitely not feeling normal, but feel pretty good and should be in hell about now.

So when I started VYVANSE again the day I quit painkillers and started sub, it worked awesome. I'm determined to not get back on sub again, and I'm glad I read that short term sub detox post online somewhere. I'm gonna try gabapentin tonite to see if it helps me sleep.

Does it help? Is it useful? Is it worth a try? I only want to use it to ween myself off the opana and for nothing else. I want personal experiences please...not website jargon. I have Valium and loperamide at my disposal. The Valium will also be used as prescribed, it's to help with anxiety and sleep. And of course a large supply of opana which I don't want to use. I know tapering is the best approach and that's what I will do. Anyways, I just miss being clear headed and being free. I hate being controlled by these pills everyday.

{"comment": "Kayaker318, I would say that with all those meds you have a good shot at doing this. My equivalence is = to 240mg of oxy. I don't have a choice but to taper. One thing you have that I don't is clonodine. That stuff is the best for the chills and hot flashes. Those are unbearable for me, along with the anxiety...In which you have the klonopin for. Those will be your life saver. On the street we called those \"super Valium\". Anyways, I would drop 5mgs a day and you have other meds to help ease the pain during that taper. I wouldn't take any clonodine until you're off the oxy completely. But, I think you can do it. You are on a low dose and you have everything they give you in detox. The rest is the mind game. What helps me is just trying to be angry at the drug and having my mind set on the fact that I'm finished. Stay convinced! Again, I was hooked on H for 3 years 2000 - 2003 and withdrawal and detox's happened pretty regularly for me. I think I am going to try the red kratom when I do my taper. I've read a ton on it and it seems to completely lessen symptoms. That along with loperamide (12-20mgs). But screw cold turkey, you have enough stuff to not have to face that beast.

{"comment": "I will make my story quick, or at least try. I hurt my back in the military, and before in the past the military doctors were big time drug pushers. They weren't trying to hurt anyone, but they realize that we were in real pain. Anyway I got to the point where I was taking 15 40 milligram oxy cotton a day, and it didn't even put a buzz on me. it was such a terrible feeling, at first painkillers and all drugs for like a bad girlfriend before she's bad. And then she turns evil, and just being around her is enough to make you think you're going to be happy, but you never are you're actually more miserable than you've ever been in your life but you convince yourself that she makes you happy. With me, I had a voice screaming in my head every minute telling me I want more oxycontin, I wanted my brain to shut the fuck up but it never would. I finally realized I was in a world of trouble when I was never going to do heroin or anything, but the amount of painkillers that was I was going through was getting pretty hard to get a hold of. Finally I found Suboxone, and I will tell you in my opinion, it is a miracle drug for me. First of all, with oxycotton, I NEVER forgot my dose! In fact I was always doing it way early and way more than I was supposed to,  one of the first things about Suboxone I realized, the voice in your head that always wanting more went quiet all of a sudden. There were days I went two days once, I forgot to take it, that's how my brain works. I never went two seconds and forgot about oxycontin. the completey makes your brain content. Now the best thing about Suboxone, is that once it's in your system, you ain't getting high on anything else. It's impossible. You could do a whole syringe full of heroin and you won't feel shit. You're probably thinking \u00c3\u00b1well that doesn't sound good\", it is food because your brain is no longer pressuring you to get high. your brain knows there's no point, you can't get high anyway. So it just shuts up. So once you start getting the box, you would have to go about 3 weeks before it gets out of your system is good.

{"comment": "First time post but thought I share my story. Actually just a very small part of it, the drug part. I must also note that I suffer from PTSD. I've been an opiate addict for 15 years. Started with Vicodin which quickly escalated to a 20-30 per day Norco Habit. This habit eventually made me so sick to my stomach, I wasn't even able look at the pills in my hand without gagging, but I still swashed them down sometimes 15 at a time (very dangerous)Then one day someone introduced me to methadone. This actually saved my life. Had a great Dr. Who prescribed me 80mg per day and kept me on a program to drop me 10mg every month, I made it all the way down to 40mg per day and my Dr. Died. (RIP) I could not find another Dr. Who would prescribe me Methadone so in comes Fentanyl.So I do browse these forums often and I'm not sure if I have seen someone yet with a habit very similar to mine. I absolutely love Fentanyl. So at my peak, every month I would get 40 - 100mcg Patches and 30 - 75 mcg. They would be gone every single month and this has been my habit for the past year and a half. I also need to mention that I didn't stick them on, like you're supposed to, I like to chew whole patches. This fixation with chewing them was most likely attributed to me quitting smoking 2 years ago today, that was a nasty 17 year habit. My fentanyl tolerance was so high that I would sometimes eat 2 100 mcg patches at once and Id get a little buzz if I weened my self down. Sometimes I would ween down just so I could get high. Fentanyl owned me.Now I do posses a very strong will and have always lived by a strong credo. I never put drugs ahead of my family, true friends or my job. I currently hold a high paying 6 Figure Upper lever Corporate Job and have been married for 20 years to my best friend. She is fully aware of my addiction and would give me her last dollar if it meant me feeling better. Which brings me to November of 2014 when almost my entire supply dries up and I'm am really hating this addictionIf you can believe this, I have only been in withdrawal 2X in my 15 year addiction and not even crazy withdrawal. The first time I didn't even know what was happening, so I went to the emergency room, thinking something was wrong. The Dr. monitored me for about 2 hours, finally asking me if I had beef taking Vicodin for any extended period of time, where of course I replied, \"No Why\" and he said, \"Because you're displaying signs of withdrawal\". I was discharged went out and picked up my script and that was the first time I knew I was addicted.The second time was while on my Methadone Maintenance, I took a few more than I should, ran out early, a friend gave me a suboxone...............need I say more? PW hell for about 2 hours until a friend brought me over some Oxy'sSo it's my opinion that in 15 years, I have been very lucky or there is still a little bit of self control left in me. I can honestly say that without a doubt, I have spent easily over $500k in the past 15 year on opiates and am hating myself for it. So let's fast forward to this November when nearly half my sources dried up, I'm sick of spending money, sick of having something control me and am ready to be done with opiates.Mid- November 2014 (15 years on opiates and a Heavy fentanyl addiction) I'm able to make it through this month decreasing my dose to about 100mcg per day, but run out at the end of the month.Dec. 1st - I come across 60 10mg Methadone. That only lasted about 6 daysDec 7th I come across 10 75mcg  5 days (Damn going Back up again)Dec 13th I come across 10 100mcg patches, Gone by the 19thDec 19th I come across 10 30mg Morphine that barely get me to the 21stDec 21st I come across 10 75mcg patches and tell myself, make them last because the holidays are coming, I'm going to need them. Because I know it's a month before I'll see anything else.Dec. 24th- I take my last 75mcg patch, (I will admit that a small part of me wanted to run out just so I would have to force myself to quit.Christmas Day Dec 25th, I convince a friend of mine to give me 5 methadone, which I took all 5 on Christmas at 8amFriday Dec. 26th a friend gives me 6 8mg Suboxone plus a dime bag of methamphetamine and a few XanaxNow like I said, I've had PW with Suboxone before so I started researching and understood the induction times but also came across some post where a few people who claimed to have rapidly detoxed by precipitating withdrawal on Suboxone. Dangerous and not many people agree that it works but now you know my habit and I'm going to share my detox Experience so far.Friday morning Dec 26th 9:00am I take 4 total 8mg Suboxone, 1 8mg every hour until about 1 o,clock. The PW's symptoms began around 10am, were just as severe as I remember and lasted all night.Sat. Morning, Dec 27th I take 1 more at 8am and the last one at 9am. I'm back in PW for another 4 hours. At about 1pm the withdrawal subsided and a little and walking around outside helped a lot plus a few hot baths.Sunday Dec 28th- in bed all day took a half Zanax and slept for about 3 hours, stretching legs yawning, sneezing but manageableMonday Dec 29tb, consumed a little methamphetamine for energy which I was able to take a shower and took a small square of a Xanax bar but still no sleep Monday Night. But I did eat an entire pineapple.Tuesday Dec. 30th- consumed a little more methamphetamine and was able to go to work. When I came home took half a Xanax and slept for 6 hoursWednesday, Dec 31- took some vitamins and feeling weak but no withdrawals. Slept about 4 hoursThursday Jan 1- Wake up early, no meds but also no withdrawals. Just weak as hellSo this Im coming up on day #5 with no opiates, weak as hell but no more withdrawal and very little sleep.This is the longest stretch ever for me. Could the worst possibly be over??I'm already determined not to ever take another opiate but is it possible this method worked for me?", "date": "01-01-2015", "time": "12:24", "datetime": 1420115040},

{"comment": "Hello please help I am 18 years old and severely addicted to painkillers and cocaine. I have been clean from cocaine for around 6 moths as I did a 90 day sentence and subsequently had to complete 30 days treatment. I am also taking 90 mg of methadone and have been taking mdone since I was 16 - long story I sustained injury when I was quite young and was first put on oxy then hydromorphone and quickly became dependant. I was taking more and more and more eventually 20 80s a day . When my injury healed my prescriptions were cut and I had to obtain more and more opiates off the streets. In the past I have abused almost anything that would get me high - benzos , opiates , heroin,  tonnes of cocaine in every form that exists , amphetamines, and many different prescription pills. I have also been homeless I lived in a shelter for about 8 months and have been in and out of jail overall spent 8 months of this year in custody witch I think saved my life. I fear that I have done significant harm to my body and now that I have been clean and thinking clearly I wonder if the doctors know what there doing or have they just caused me more harm then good ? I wish I never took pain meds for my injury as it has only brought me more pain. I am also prescribed 150 mg of seroquel at night for insomnia and sleep paralysis,  and Lorazepam for anxiety I was perscribed diazepam for insomnia and sleep paralysis but found it only made the sleep paralysis worse so i decided to stop taking it. I also understand that it is quite dangerous to mix benzos and meth. I used to take lots of benzos but decided to detox while in jail and I'm very glad I did. Now I take only a small dose of ativan PRN for anxiety. I fear that if I don't maintain Control of my life I won't make it past 30. Most of all I don't want to suffer anymore I just want to live comfortably and make something of my life but I have so much holding me back. Please help me. Now that I clean I dunno what to do. Please help and advice and info would be appreciated . I have been thinking of how I will ever stop taking mdone? (I used to take upwards of 120 mg/day which was reduced to 90 mg when I was arrested and missed 2 or 3 doses) what should I expect when tapering and eventually detoxing?  How long will it take to get off this dose of methadone?  I also question how safe it is for someone my age to be on this dose of mdone ? Please if anyone has experience with methadone I would really appreciate your opinion . I'm sick of all the doctors and I dunno if they are doing me any good considrring they got me hooked on this shit in the firat place and put someone my age on these serious meds. Its alwats more meds. sometimes I just wanna quit taking methadone all togather it's to much of a roller coaster. I appolagize for the long post I just dont want to miss out on any details. Sometimes wonder what I would be like if I didn't abuse my body and mind to the extent that I have. Do you think If I stay clean my body can heal or is the damage irreversible?. My nose is damaged and I wonder about my liver and if the meth is harming it . Thanks again any help be much appreciated.", "date": "25-01-2015", "time": "22:26", "datetime": 1422224760},

Because of this SWIM ends up taking said pills too fast and runs out early every time. SWIM will usually buy other types of pain pills off the street when needed until those run dry too.. at said point what is SWIM to do? Try a hospital? A methadone clinic? A rehab? Go to a private doctor for sub/sub script? Any ideas u guys have are very welcome. SWIM is too much of a wuss to go through WD cold turkey and has tried before at a 200-300mg a day level with no avail. Please tell me your thoughts and tricks for getting by...

{"comment": "Tommy7... - you're too young to despair so much, but I understand you've been through a lot, that's not criticism, just an observation most would agree that I am correct concerning your situation. Homeless at 16 is very rough, I'm not making lite of your situation.I was on methadone 200-mg/day and successfully tapered to 30-mg (several relapses once i got under 70-mg, but eventually I got to 30-mg). You can get Medicaid if you don't already have it- seriously, destitute men are now qualified to get Medicaid, at least in my state - which adopted Obamacare. Consider moving to my state- Colorado. In Denver i know a dozen or two people homeless and your age, so I'm used to helping out through my HR work - been doing this several years as a volunteer. I know I've helped at least a few get off opioids by finding them hard to access services.Sounds like you have blow, crack whatever type of coke under control. Please tell us (or PM if you want privacy) and let us know what you're using now, your post isn't totally clear, are you currently using meth? That post screams meth (long, no breaks, good grammar and spelling). I'm not judging, but I need to know your living, substances and emotional situation, truthfully, to effectively help you the best.Here, I'll demonstrate - I take clonazepam, Etizolam, bupe, mood stabilizers, and old man stuff (cholesterol, high b.p.). I'm older, 46.Do you have a roof over your head again or are you still on the streets? Stability first, taper second is my opinion. You could switch to low dose bupe at 30-mg methadone, probably higher but most docs require three days w/ds off 30-mg methadone (DEA/FDA bullshit) b/f you start bupe. I'd never go above 4-mg sublingual or 1-2 mg insulfated, do not go over 8-mg, really 2- to 4-mg should hold you.But now you've still got a dependency on a long term opioid. So... may not be your thing. Can you switch to a short acting opioid and taper yourself? If so I recommend dope or oxy for a week or two maximum, then taper that and deal with much shorter, but more intense w/ds, this takes immense self-control and stability... ! I strongly suggest you try to get meds legitimately. But if you can't, that's understood as common, just be careful and don't get caught up with LE anymore than you have to if at all possible. If you have to street buy, try finding as stable dealer with a home to go see him at, if you must use street drugs.There is a lot of hope for you, even though I sense your despair, you feel like a piece of sheit, I've been there. Be easy on yourself if you can. Exercise! Every day. Taking a lone, quite walk for a half hour and try to clear your mind.

Friday i went to work and was fine untill about 10am when the same thing hit. Luckily i work in a hospital and was rushed to a ekg machine and once again everything was fine. Its like a feeling that i am seriously going to die and idk if its withdrawals or not. I have a messed up shoulder so i have been taking 2-3 percs or vicodins for the last 2 months . This feeling happened about 6 hours after my last dose. Again the feeling starts as butterflies in my stomach, chest is tingly and burning almost like nothing is inside it. My emotions go haywire and i feel a dread that shouldnt be possible? Ive had all bloodwork done, ekg, piss tests and everything came back normal.

{"comment": "I am new here after lurking for years.  I am trying to taper off my oxycodone and am bored to death, which is making the time just drag.  I have the time to go C.T. However, I went C.T. off of oxycodone, vicodin, alcohol, and xanax back in March 2013 and was sick and anxious as f&*k. But not sick enough to forego making a conscious decision to go back on oxy's, prescribed, a year ago.  Why?  I was bored.  I think my shi#*y personality contributes to my addiction issues.  Anyway, I am dead serious about this taper, b/c my pain management doc does not take insurance, only $$$ or credit card, and is expensive.  I want a new car, and I can't afford both. So, to amuse myself, I have done a ton of research on taper schedules, both on forums like BL as well as on medical sites, and have written out a detailed plan.  It is a slow taper, because I do not want to feel like I did with C.T. I am on a relatively low dose, and am embarrassed when I read here how others can quit, especially the gear users. I found out that if I lapse even once on my taper, I go right back where I was.  Anyway, I am dosing every 10 hours, with mild, but annoying wd symptoms kicking in at about 7 hours after dosing, and get worse until I take my next pill at the 10 hour mark.

{"comment": "Hi, I'm new here.I have been trying to detox at home from a long standing opiate addiction. It has been a struggle that has extended over the past ten years. Having subutex, it is possible to detox at home, although, I have been unsuccessful sticking solely to the buprenorphen and continues to use over the medication and generally ends up getting back into the old routine of using H. In the past, SWIM has had a prescription to klonopin which has helped him tremendously with general anxiety. I am aware that benzos can be very helpful when it comes to dealing with the initial withdrawals from H, but does not want to jump back onto the benzo train. It was extremely hard to get off of the klonopin and I'm actually quite proud of having gotten off of the medication. Anyway, I'm trying to kick his opiate addiction and today, after having taken 2mg of subutex, ended up using on top of the medication. This has been my track record. Frustrated and confused, I need help committing to the subutex. I never really give it a chance. I'm aware that using ontop of the medication is counterproductive, but I've just not been able to stick to the medication alone. Could it be that I'm is not taking enough of the subutex initially to curb the cravings and withdrawals? Does anyone suggest anything to someone who cannot commit to subutex? I was planning on entering an inpatient treatment facility today, but having been told that I must first finish a two week detox program, I became frustrated and ended up using. In addition, I have a friend who has some LSD. After doing some research, I'm curious if anyone has ever tried taking LSD while undergoing opiate withdrawal? This could very well be a recipe for disaster, but having read about the success of other hallucinogens, namely ibogaine, I'm curious if other hallucinogens, like LSD, may have similar results? This is really quite far-fetched but I am now extremely desperate and frustrated and is willing to try anything in order to change his destructive lifestyle.

{"comment": "I'm new around here and have a TON of questions, I guess it's best to just start one at a time...Here's the Sitchu:  I hurt, all the time -and I'm on a TON of pain meds which just aren't working any more.  I've been on opioid pain treatment under the care of a pain mgt dr since the late 90's - (god I can't believe I'm stating anything in terms of 25 years because I'm still young-ish - but there it is!) So, I'm on Morphine for my long acting, a variety of percs and Subsys for fast acting. I feel like I have the constitution of an ox -I have such a high tolerance.  I figure my receptors are just maxed out making the meds  less effective. Soooo, I'm considering pressing the reset button.  A couple of quesions I have are as follows:Does any body know how I would go about seeking out a local facility that offers a\"rapid detox\" program such as the one refered to in the beginning of this thread?   A program where I am somehow sedated would be my preference because I am incredibly worried about the pain during the detox.  I'm currently in bad pain on the meds, I fear it will be unthinkable compounded with pain from withdraws! The alternative is titrating the dose on my own.  I've never abused my meds and don't think I'm psychologically addicted - it's been a battle but I think I've maintained control.  I'm wondering what would happen if I just took - one less morphine - or one less perc a day progressively.  I've played with this a little and found it's way more easy to back off on the morphine than the rescue meds, but I suspect it's more important to reduce the doses of the short acting ones (ie perc/subsys).  Does any one have any input on the best way to do this?  My heart is in the right place but I don't know if I'm going about this the right way.

{"comment": "Hey Drew, welcome to BluelightEven if you made it one day already I highly suggest to taper your dose down because jumping off at 8mg will potentially result in a very strong withdrawal that starts after a few days and will take a long time to get through with. You will probably be in for a hell of a ride, if you decide to do it this way. The WD usually starts to get going hard after 3-5 days because of the long half-life of Buprenorphine.Generally it is advised to taper as far as <1mg, like down to 0,5mg and then jump off. So I would get some more and follow this pattern.After the jump prepare with meds like Loperamide for the diarrhea, something against puking like Antihistamines, MCP or Odansetron and most important Gabapentin or Lyrica because these two meds diminish a lot of the umpleasant WD-symptoms. Plus maybe a few Benzos for the first nights to help you sleep and you should be good.But jumping off at 8mg could be too intense, I would never dare to do it at such a high dose but my habit was always pretty small.If you have any questions, read the Subutex/Suboxone Withdrawal Thread.

{"comment": "Hello world, first time posting on this site.  I am currently using oxycodone 30mg, approx 120mg per day. I've come to the point where I'm sick of being broke, lying to people, etc and I want my life back. I've gone cold turkey before and lasted a couple months. Then one night I decided I could have one and fell right back in. I'm here looking for moral support, but also any pointers or suggestions that will help ease this horrible transition.  So here are some facts to help understand my current status:120mg per day approxsupplies I have (thanks to my buddy):(2)8mg suboxone pills (can get more if necessary but I'd rather not)(29)0.2mg clonidine tablets(30)50mg trazodone pills(40)10mg cyclobenzaprine (flexeril)i understand and I have to \"pay the piper\" for the mistakes I've made, but I also know that these drugs can ease the transition. However, I do not want to replace one addiction with another, so I'm looking for help regarding how to use these supplies safely and effectively.Please respond with with any knowledge at all.

{"comment": "^^^^ Honestly with a modest habit like that I would do one of two things, either use the clonidine 3x a day and maybe the traz on the first few nights, maybe split the clonidine in half tho as the .2's r pretty hefty OR wait until you are in pretty hefty WD and take just one 8 mg suboxone JUST one time and let it taper itself out of your system and deal with the lingering wds that will hit u in about 3-4 days after you dose the sub. And I would throw immodium into the first strategy as well....just enough to shut down the shit factory for the first few days...kratom could be another viable option for you as well", "date": "23-04-2015", "time": "05:34", "datetime": 1429767240},

{"comment": "Hello everyone, I have a question about a stepping down processes, I am unsure if I am doing anything to actually step down or just resetting the clock so to speak. Basically I have been using for 2 months straight, the first month was just hydrocodone and oxycodone about 35 - 50 mg a day. The last month has been H I don't really know weight doses but enough to make it difficult to pass urine and very constipated which for me is a sign I high doses of a strong opioid. A few days ago I decided to stop the H because I went from smoking to IV and from past experience that is a major red flag for me, even with about 25 - 35 mg of oxy I still felt some nasty WD's. So here is my first question, was taking the oxy instead of the H doing anything in terms of stepping down or making my WD's less severe? Question 2, I'm thinking about taking hydrocodone for 5 or 6 days about 25 - 35 mg max daily, is that going to help in terms of WD severity when I step off the hydrocodone? Or am I just delaying the inevitable and am going to feel severe WD no matter which way I go about it? I will say it seems that the intensity of WD has lowered a bit because when I stepped off the H after 12 hours it was BAD but since I've been taking only oxy it seems 12 hours later isn't as bad.People have told me to try and get on subs or methadone but I don't feel I'm at a level which would require that kind of plan. This all started because I got clean for about 4 years and THOUGHT I could handle a once and a blue moon type of thing which has backfired and went horribly wrong. Any advice would be appreciated I know its hard to gauge over the internet and everyone is different I'm just looking to get some opinions and maybe a ballpark estimate if what I'm doing is somewhat going to help if, if my questions make any sense at all.", "date": "29-04-2015", "time": "01:45", "datetime": 1430271900},

{"comment": "^^^ disagree with you except for the imodium120mg of oxycodone a day is definitely not a modest habit. Its certainly at least a moderate habit. I wouldn't take that much clonidine either. What I would do is wait till I felt like shit and take half of a quarter of one of those 8mg suboxone pills (1mg) and just one clonidine and see if you can sleep.Even if you pass out, I find myself day 2 to be worse especially during Oxy withdrawal. I'd probably need the full quarter of suboxone. But keep in mind the worse you feel, generally the sooner you'll feel better.Taking a 50mg trazadone with one of those clonidines and a flexeril will either be VERY sedating, or will worsen any RLS you might have at that point. Especially the flexeril. It's a good muscle relaxer but be warned.. It can cause major  akasthia during opiate withdrawal.Take as little suboxone as you can. Use 12mg doses of imodium from the drug store to help stop the shits.. And use the clonidine and possibly trazadone at night to help you sleep.", "date": "02-05-2015", "time": "07:15", "datetime": 1430550900},
{"comment": "Okay everyone, listen up...I read many threads about the withdrawals and let me explain everything you'll go through.I done every type of pain pill, suboxone, the patches even was hooked on xanax, for years, I dont see much about long term usage effects, very different from someone using for 6mths-year, withdrawling for their first time, long term users can experience longer withdrawls and repeated symptoms. If you are planning to stop cold turkey, listen up, see a doctor first and explain and don't leave without xanax, any benzo's, you'll need them and get everything ready, you won't have the energy later.First most important, any opiates your taking you need to bring it down to a level to able to withstand the withdrawals, anyone taking high doses shouldn't even be reading this, your still abusing. My wife was on fentynal patches, 100mgs, that's a lot and in two maths got her down to oxy 20mg, the final script we decided to take 10mg for a few days then a qtr pill, 5mg for a few days then it begins.First you'll sleep a day, maybe even two but on the 3rd day withdrawals really begin due to any opiates still in your system, once out then be ready, just remember that it will end, in time.You'll get brain flashes, nerve ending tweaking in your face, on your lips, hot flashes, hot flashes last a few days to a week, usually, for my wife and me. The the uncomfortable feeling something eating away at you inside, sick to your stomach. Then the mental game, RLS, insomnia.Let's start with a plan and let me explain that a lot of drugs are being mentioned on here to cope but in the end it can just prolong your withdrawals and some meds can make things worse, like RLS, I tried baclphon muscle relaxer, made my RLS worse and also, benadryol for sleep didn't work and made my RLS 10x worse.Plan that worked for me;Started taking vitamins, right before stopping would be best, a multi V, vitamin B complex, vitamin B12 (vitamin B for energy, nerves) and potassium for nerves also, L-tyrosine for energy.First started taking 2 multi vitamins daily, with Vitamins B,s and potassium. You'll need your vitamins so your body heals, it helps but don't think you'll feel any different, will help some with energy lvl's and the fact you can't eat.You can try L-tyrosine later as you feel better, atleast a week before you'll be able to get around.Take xanax for sleep, try not to take it durning the day the first week, withdrawal, get it out of you first because insomnia will kick in on day 4 and you WILL not be able to sleep...no matter what. I had done this without any xanax and was up for 8 straight days without no sleep until I finally fell asleep for a half hour, a day later got an hour sleep and more sleep as days went on. Your brain has to reprogram your natural sleep pattern, you been going to bed drowsy everyday so its something you'll have to deal with, even taking xanax will still prevent your natural sleeping pattern from coming back so do not take xanax daily for a long period of time, then you'll have to withdrawal from that and to me it was worse than opiates, lucky for me i got off benzos a year before all this.See Thomas recipe for vitamins, minerals you'll need.The first week is hard, take xanax as needed for sleep and will help with nerves and RLS, there are meds for RLS which can be fine if only using for a week, any meds will just prolong withdrawals so get it over with. Take hot showers, if you get sleep, stay up all day and keep your mind active, try eating soup, banana's, anything easy to get down, a little at a time. I believe my first week wasn't so bad, the hot flashes, sneezing (will go on for a month due to your nose being so dry) as fluid starts coming back to your nose it will eventually stop. The eerie feeling of wanting to rip off my skin, no energy..etc. As for me, week two was worse, the mental game begins, very restless, I drank sometimes and got shit faced to kill the pain, my wife swears weed helped her a lot, made things worse for me, I did try Lyrica and seemed to help but only took for a few days then my brain was tweaking again.It always seemed any meds that did help gave some relief but prolonged withdrawals, just because I'm not sick as a dog doesn't mean I'm not withdrawaling, withdrawals can last a month even two months with repeated symptoms which may not last long but can come back, this is why I state, spread out them xanax, you'll need them.Week one had maybe 1-2mg xanax, week two 1mg a day, week 3 half mg a day. I did save a few on the side for down the road, I'm on week 6 and still feel some restless, low energy but I get better each.Now with no xanax, I'll have a few beers, rum and coke for the mental part, I'm now thinking much clearer, more active everyday, keeping busy, now eating better, no more vitamins, I'm finding food now comforts me as i now get bored quite easily.I do not find myself wanting any oxy's, maybe a xanax here and there but I know I need to heal, your body needs to be COMPLETELY off everything, drug free for you to heal.Do not take suboxone unless its only for a week to bring your self down, suboxone withdrawals are very bad, I know! Most meds listed on blue light for relief may, may not help but just remember, long term abusers (years) will will prolong symptoms.People mention having sex helps, it does and will help you sleep better.After 6 weeks, my head still rings some, some low energy, now having coffee in the morning helps, it took a  month for my natural sleeping pattern to come back, now getting 6-8 hrs sleep everyday.I now don't care to get high but only to get healthy, you can get permanent nerve damage from long term usage, your nerves will soon return to normal but may take a month.Finally done and never have to worry about running out of pills or worrying about getting sick again. Many will agree, many won't but from experience I know what worked for me and know any meds won't make things better, only use for short time relief and get on with getting better, trust me, it will all be worth it.Good luck everyone and stay clean.", "date": "08-05-2015", "time": "04:27", "datetime": 1431059220},
{"comment": "Here we go again. For 2 years I was clean, about 6 months ago I had a major relapse. During this last 6 months I had a 7 day straight clean period, but other than that I would say 2/3s of the 6 months have been oxycodone and hydrocodone and 1/3 of that time being heroin, smoked & IV.Tomorrow I am going to attempt to go through WD and take a minimum of a 6 month hiatus from all opioids. I am honestly scared because I don't know if I can do it. All I have at my disposal is 15 mg of hydrocodone, 12 mg of kolonopin and a bunch of naproxen. I hope this acute WD's only last 5 or 6 days but who knows, I have made list of food & drink items and a kind of \"to do\" list like go for a walk, take the dog to the dog park, visit friends, watch some Netflix, etc etc.I am hoping I will be able to do things like jog, go for a hike, work out, basically things that will break a good sweat. Will a somewhat rigorous exercise especially if I am bale to break into a good solid sweat speed up and finish the acute withdrawal faster because I'm sweating out toxins and whatnot? Does my recent opioid use sound like I am in for some really gnarly intense withdrawal?Man I hope I can get through this, I've attempted to detox 4 or 5 times in the past 2 months.

{"comment": "So I posted last night about AFOAF and their extract process. But now AFOAF wants to know about what the conversion should be if AFOAF had been on a Methadone Maintenance Program for 3 years at a 1 time daily dose of 90-100mg, and is getting the Fent Patches now instead. AFOAF has said that it doesn't seem to be enough (The Fent 50mcg/hour). To the point where when AFOAF wakes up in the morning, his entire body feels somewhat numb/tingling feeling/pulsating feeling, almost like they feel their entire heartbeat throughout their entire body. This isn't something this person had ever experienced with patches until now, the Methadone never did this either, but once he got off the M.M.P. this feeling started happening, and has continued even to this day. It doesn't happen constantly, mainly when this person wakes up, sometimes it'll wake AFOAF up in the middle of the night. Or even when they are just sitting down. Any suggestions as to what this could be? AFOAF has heard of P.A.W.S. but doesn't see these symptoms being part of that. It's kinda driving AFOAF crazy and is afraid to tell their P.M. Dr. about it, in fear of the doc taking the scripts for the Fent Patches away. AFOAF ABSOLUTELY DOES NOT WANTS TO GO BACK ON A METHADONE MAINTENANCE PROGRAM.

I took xanax for a week (about a week ago) and now went through insomnia again and some RLS, nerve endings tingling (many feet), even after all this time, lasted only a few days but still returned.

{"comment": "The one thing I rarely see mentioned is how withdrawal works in a long term addict.  I'm coming up on 10 years of use now and have climbed the ladder up and back down again.For me every time I go back I end up with horrible acute withdrawal the day after.  Sometimes I can get away with one use, but one use usually turns into a run.  If I have a two-three day run then quit I'll go through a 12-24 hour withdrawal phase that's really bad.  Not as bad as when I had an Opana + benzo habit but worse than I would have expected with the level of substances I have been using.  We're talking been clean for 2 years and can nod off 40-50mg of Hydrocodone type of sessions.If I use for a week I might has well have never quitopioids.  Even Hydro will leave me in a bad way and I have to ride out \"the flu\" at home for three-four days.  Every time I go back and use the withdrawal just seems more pronounced, lasts longer, and sets in faster.  If doesn't matter if I opt for morphine or oxycodone or whatever else.

{"comment": "Been using codeine for years, at fairly low doses until last year, and was also combining with huge amounts of kratom, which I kicked a few months ago.  The first 3 days of the kratom withdrawal came with terrible depression and empty feelings, but were pretty much over within 3 days.  Wind forward to last week, when I had been using about 800mg of codeine a day, in 2 smaller doses, followed by a treat of 400-450mg each night a few hours before bed.On the Thursday I performed my last CWE, and also drank 2 bottles of wine, despite not usually drinking, as I had 4 solid days away from work and planned to lose the codeine. I had a few Paramol and Nurofen plus tablets lying around, so used these on the first day as a kind of mini taper, rather than throw them away.  Unlike with the kratom, I had no crippling depression, and very few symptoms the first day, just a bit fatigued and a feeling something was missing.  Got through Saturday, though that night the RLS started up and didn't get much sleep, but I was feeling strong, and on the Sunday I started to feel very chirpy and managed to do some reading and potter about, thinking that once I got through Monday I would really be out of the woods and able to stay off.Sunday night the RLS etc gets worse, I can't sleep at all, and so I get up 72 hours after my last CWE and suddenly it's like I'm on day one - emptiness, anxiety, fatigue, very low mood.  I was prepared for 3 days of not feeling that great, with one extra day to get ready for work, but here comes day 4 and it's the worst so far.  I have a job where I have to be very sharp mentally and emotionally and can't just wing it, so I caved in and did a pharmacy run.  I decided not to go down the CWE route again, just munched about 80mg worth of codeine pills, (at relatively safe doses of 800mg ibuprofen and 1g apap plus the codeine).I hope this is just a setback and I can find another window to stay on a maintenance level without the late night CWEs and then finally jump off (as when I last jumped off a taper it was relatively painless, I just ended going back weeks later due to big stresses).Am curious what caused the delayed onset of the more troublesome withdrawals, am in very good health generally, can run 10 miles, just wonder if it took my system a while to cotton on to my plan or something else, but it's very frustrating setting the time aside and then running out of time because the worst of the w/d starts on the last planned day.  It's interesting to compare above about w/d coming on faster each time, as I have done quite a few w/ds and usually well over the worst by day 4, but in this case they came on much slower for some reason.Guess I may never know but hope to keep to a low dose, possibly taper down more, then jump when I get a window, I just can't afford to end up screwing up important stuff by feeling 50% at work!This morning I couldn't tie my shoelaces, tonight I've been cleaning and did the shopping etc - did another dose of approx 80mg, it's so tiny it's ridiculous, and in the past I've withdrawn from Oxy a number of times and can't figure out how codeine w/d can be quite this bad, but the 80mg has made me feel normal.  Maybe this is a good sign, if I can level out for a bit, maybe taper down until I get the next chance to jump off and hopefully off a lower dose it will be easier....", "date": "18-05-2015", "time": "23:15", "datetime": 1431990900},

{"comment": ".  Anyways, my boyfriend and I are going on a cruise on saturday.  I had known it would be time to quit a week in advance (pushing it a little..yes..however i just wanted the physical withdrawal symptoms to run their course before we left).  I am on hour 24 of no opiates.  I was not a VERY heavy user (anywhere between 3-8 bags per day depending on the money I had).  I prepared for this by collecting a few .5 xanaxes, and a bunch of 50 mg trazadones for sleep.  This morning upon waking up, the death began.  I was weak, the diarrhea was unbearable, I went into work and ended up having to leave an hour later.  I could not do it.  I took two of the xanaxes, hoping for the best, but ended up feeling drowsy and no relief from any other symptoms.  Took 3 immodiums which stopped the diarrhea.When i got home, i got through to my guy for suboxone.  I've heard this only prolongs the withdrawal, but as you other bluelighters must know, the pain I was going through was too much to not rip off a small piece of it and stick it under my tongue.  I then passed out for a few hours and woke up feeling much much better.  Now I am sitting here writing to you guys looking for as much advice as possible to get me through this withdrawal and hopefully feel better by Saturday when we leave.  I have to work everyday this week in order to have money to bring with me.  I have 1 and a half strips of subs left.  Should I leave them alone tomorrow unless i'm feeling incredibly weak again?  Or am I screwing myself more? Should i take the trazadone tonight to sleep and if so, how many? When do I take the xanax?  I am so clueless. Just please help me get through the next 2 days to get this dope out of my system.  Please help.  Thank you.", "date": "19-05-2015", "time": "05:45", "datetime": 1432014300},

{"comment": "Hey guys. I have been lurking for quite a while now and decided it was time to register & ask some questions.2 days ago, I was removed from my Methadone clinic because of financial problems.I was on 40 mg liquid daily for a little over a year & am cold turkeying this, obviously, because I have to. Not by choice.I say day 2, but really this is how it happened:, I did not dose. Decided since I knew this was coming, I wanted to get high one last time. (stupid drug addict thinking.) I double dosed, because of the take home for Sunday., was dropped 10 mg to 30 mg & sent on my merry way., I've had nothing and am already feeling pretty rough. Pretty rough is definitely an understatement. I feel like I did when I decided to go to the clinic in the first place. (I was shooting 120 mg Oxycodone, daily. More when I could.)I can't eat, I've throw up once, so not too bad I guess. I can't sleep. Severe R-L-S. I just feel like these withdrawals set on VERY quickly, and am kind of mind blown. I have yet to experience diarrhea & am actually still quite constipated. I guess I just decided to post this to get some insight on what I can do, if anything, to give this agony a little less of an edge.How long can one typically expect to experience this hell? I've heard anywhere from 15 days - 2 months.I've taken 2 HOT baths today, taken a Lyrica, Soma & a hand full of Melatonin & still cannot get sleep. I'm not sure how to get through this, let alone without sleep. I am at my lowest low, ever.Depression has set in as well. Beating myself up over getting on the Methadone, but it was a last resort because I had my baby son on the way & could not continue down the reckless road I was on, for both of our sakes.Any help through this would be greatly appreciated. This has taken so long to write, so i'm sorry if it's scattered. I've had to get up and move around because of the R-L-S, a lot & all I can think about is running into town to grab some dillies & put 'em in my arm.Last edited by jordan2010; 20-05-2015 at.", "date": "20-05-2015", "time": "00:47", "datetime": 1432082820},

{"comment": "Absolutely my brother. Two nights of use and I'm going to be \"considerably uncomfortable\" the third night without opiates in my system. Three nights in a row and I will be in fully pronounced withdrawal, regretting every decision I've made in the past 72hrs. Easier said than done, but I've managed to avoid sickness the past month by sticking to one day on, two days off. Not necessarily that pattern on repeat.... but if I use one day, I'm DEFINITELY not gonna use the next day. No matter what. It keeps me clean for the most part.The key is mental strength. If you're just coming off opiates long-term, this isn't gonna work for you. You need to first prove to yourself that you can exercise some degree of control over your use. A few times a week. A couple days on, a couple days off. Learn how to cope with minor withdrawal and become a pro at it. FUCK feeling sorry for yourself and PAY THE PIPER for choosing to get high every day for these past three weeks.... you get what I'm saying?At least that's what I did. Then I decided I wanted to be....clean. I wanted to do away with...- The PHYSICAL NEED for opiates.- The priority of shooting opiates over all other priorities in my life.- The health risks that come with the game- The overall unhealthiness such as being skinny, bags under my eyes, etc.- Money issuesSo I quit for a few weeks. After three weeks the opiates were pretty much completely out of my system and I began to use one bag of heroin once a week. With my diminished tolerance, I got a lot higher than I expected. At first the mental craving to do another bag the next day was almost overwhelming, but I dealt with it.", "date": "20-05-2015", "time": "07:56", "datetime": 1432108560},

{"comment": "Good to know I'm not the only one out there.  I've been mostly clean going on 2 years now aside from a couple of days/weeks of use here and there.  I don't crave opioids every day anymore and I rarely think about them.  Eventually I'll get a craving and it'll overwhelm my thinking until I go out and get something (even if I wait a week or two before using).  A one time use will straighten me out and I won't think about them anymore for a long time if I quit then and there.My issue is when I decide to use again the next day (or the day after).  If something is available on hand I will use it, and I will continue to use until I get very high.  There is no saving a morning dose with me, once I'm above a certain level I just continue to blow through the stash until it's all gone.  God forbid I do someone a favor and they give me pills instead of cash, those things never last too long if they are in the house.I know this isn't a good way of thinking so I avoid them all of the time now unless that thing clicks in my head and I start obsessing about a nod session for weeks at a time.  I'll even turn the opioids down from the doctor/dentist for fear of what would happen if I had an entire bottle of pills in the house.  But an addict I remain.Maybe one day the withdrawals will get horrible enough that I'll quit all together.  I doubt that day will ever come though.Oh well my current situation is better than before at least.  No more daily grind to score and I don't have to deal with \"those people\" (friends stealing/scamming) anymore unless I go out of my way to do that.Oh one last thing:  The last time I went into withdrawal I had used for 5 straight days and by day two I was still sick in a bad way.  Nose running, the bubble guts, unable to hold down food/no desire for food etc.  A friend was kind and offered me about 3-5mg of oxycodone.  I took that and all symptoms subsided within 15 minutes.  I had a STRONG desire to do more but was not allowed anymore out of his stash.  I showered, cooked and ate a good meal and drank a ton of water.  4 hours or so after taking the oxycodone I could feel withdrawal setting back in but not nearly as bad as before.  I woke up the next day still in minor withdrawal but no where near as horrible as it would have usually been for me.So I guess tapering does work...as long as you have great self control or no access to more opioids.", "date": "21-05-2015", "time": "16:30", "datetime": 1432225800},
{"comment": "Hey, Kara.April. I am currently on day 4 of a CT 40 mg methadone withdrawal. I'm an absolute train wreck. I wouldn't take any subs.

{"comment": "Hello all,For everyone who has made the induction from a potent full agonist (heroin, dilaudid, opana, etc) to Bupe, you are all too aware that the first few days, esp day 1, can be an extremely unpleasant transition. I'm not referring to precipitated WD from dosing the bupe too soon, just the act of switching from a potent full agonist to the partial agonism that bupe offers can be pretty brutal.With that in mind, I'm curious if anyone tries to cross Titrate the full agonist and bupe simultaneously to ease what can otherwise be a jarring transition.For those that aren't familiar w what cross titration is, it would look something like this:Say you have been maintaining on 8mg dilaudid IV around 6 times a day and you now want to switch to bupe. The idea I'm proposing is on the morning you decide to make the switch, you dose a small dose of bupe, maybe .25 to .5mg. Within 30mins to an hr you will likely begin to feel uncomfortable and hints to WD, at which point you dose a full 8mg IV dilaudid. Later that day you dose a bit more bupe, perhaps another .5mg, and some time after that another dose of dilaudid, and repeat this process that day.The next day you dose a bit higher on the bupe and drop your dilaudid dose.This process is repeated but by day 3 or 4 at the latest, you should be fully switched over to bupe and no longer taking the dilaudid or whatever is your full agonist of choice.I want to be clear I am not suggesting anyone try this as I've not experienced myself, it just theoretically seems to me to be a way to ease that transition to make things more manageable.What I would LOVE to hear is from anyone who has done something like thiis and what their experience was like relative to the usual bupe induction of simply waiting for WD to kick in and abruptly switching to bupe. Your cross titration doesn't have to be exactly like my example, but I'm just hoping to hear experiences from people who have tried this type of approach- slowly adding small doses of bupe will simultaneously dropping their dose of full agonist until you have fully converts to bupe.I would think this would make for a smoother transition. The initial low doses of bupe shouldn't be enough for precip WD to be a concern. However it is possible that ppl who have tried this found it didn't make the transition any smoother and simply prolonged the unpleasant induction phase.Surely people have tried this, so I'd really appreciate if you would share your experiences.

Felt happy, emotionally content, smiled, wanted to hug my guy friends etc. cool.Tried it again 3days later (thursday) and my friend had separated two tenths for me on a card, I was a little drunk and snorted part of the 2nd line after doing the first one. I felt great for about 10 minutes, then I started to feel extremely overwhelmed, like I took a glob of a dab my first time or something. I was able to handle it and stay in control for only a little, then it got too much. I went from falling asleep to waking up sweating like crazy. Dont remember much else aside from dry heaving for what seemed like forever then finally vomiting. Next morning I told myself it wasn't worth it and to get out now.By Saturday I felt like I was coming down with the flu. Same symptoms as always, high fever, cold sweats, zero appetite, always thirsty but unable to drink water. I puked all the water I had in my stomach, no food at all. My friend then told me I don't have the flu and what I'm going through is withdrawals from heroin.Is it possible only after 2 uses? I feel like 500% shit, always nauseous and even the smell of food makes me throw up. I've lost at least 10 pounds. Do I have the flu or am I seriously going through withdrawals? I can't get my hands on any wax or weed till the weekend. I know it'll help, I wanna sleep this off. Literally can't eat, can't sleep, and I can't stop thinking about calling up my friend for some h cause I know that's how you cure this shitty feeling, though i dont want to get hooked.What should I do?

{"comment": "I have chronic pain caused by endometriosis. Basically I figured out that I don't need mess 24 hrs a day and only 2 weeks of the month.  I have a question about this whole Fentanyl patch (Mylan Brand) thing I've been experiencing. I was started on 25 mcg every 48 hours for two years straight. I went through all kinds of hell and was finally stabilized using oxycodone as a break through medication. I then decided that I didn't want to take it anymore, so I dropped to 12.5 mcg every 48 hours. With that I ended up on Dilaudid as break through.  When I took the patch off and flushed the rest of them, it was May 22nd. I used the hell out of that Dilaudid for an entire week, hoping it would mask the withdrawal symptoms. Instead I think I ended up having to withdraw from that. I didn't miss a single day of work but felt like shit for about 7 days, then got this crazy burning in my stomach after taking loperamide for a week. I ended up in the hospital but they said I had gastritis and that I should be fine in 3 days. It's been like 10 and my gut keeps going back and forth between okay and feeling like shit. Is this the Dilaudid so much later, or just the regular feeling of Fentanyl patch withdrawal? I've been pretty comfortable all things considered. Can anyone help with some insight into this situation with my guts? Feels like I can feel it eating itself.

{"comment": "I have read these forums, gosh knows how many times after helping a friend get off a 150mg a day Oxy habit.First I can only agree with the Thomas Recipe, those supplies are essential and you should stock up well in advance.I wanted to add some extra items to this approach.Firstly Benadryl, my friend found it works best if you take 50mg an hour before bedtime, and just as you are falling asleep, take another 100mg. This will provide you with a valuable extra 45m to 1 hour of sleep, which if you are getting 2 hours is an extra 50pc.Second, if you can, try and time your last dose in the evening, about 7pm, 8pm. This will give you a good nights sleep before going through the hell of day 1 and day 2. In addition, when you wake up, you will be strong to face the day. My friend tried to give up and timed it all wrong (last dose at 1pm, which meant WD kicking in at 9pm, anxiety kicked in at 11pm and no sleep) and guess what the call went in the next day as she just could not handle it.Lastly, as has been mentioned many times, you need a plan after you give up, and how you are going to fulfill that reward center (Plan meets with friends, set goals, attend meetings) My friend did not have a plan the first 2 times and after a few days, gave in.Anyhow I hope that someone finds this information useful.", "date": "17-06-2015", "time": "19:20", "datetime": 1434568800},

The next day, I was having flu-like symptoms. I would push the covers off only to put them back on a few minutes later. I felt depressed, I got frustrated at everything, I felt nauseated the whole day. I decided to go cold turkey before I kept up the cycle with this horrible drug. I'm a big OC fan, so I thought H would be tolerable. Boy was I wrong. Can anyone give me some more insight on what I ACTUALLY went through the next day? H isn't all it's made out to be and I am satisfied with cannabis, I am also going into pharmaceuticals which were my reasons for stopping so early.

{"comment": "^IMO, opiate WD. Must have been from all of the OCs and Percs before the dope that contributed. The symptoms are virtually the same for opiate pharms and dope, but the duration of WD will vary depending on the specific half life of the particular drug.DOXEPIN. (Sinequan). I love this shit as do many other ppl in recovery.Sleep is always impossible to come by during WD and is what makes me relapse before anything else. I once went 8 days without sleep during WD before I broke down and copped. Insomnia SUCKS SO HARD and I feel you.  This was prescribed to me and everyone else w/sleep probs in REHAB. I was dubious of an anti - depressant being helpful. After all, I was prescribed ambien (zolpidem) for years which sucked for long term use bc of tolerance. Anyway everyone loved their Sinequan and took between 75mgs-200mgs every night. It works right away the first night and will make you sleep so deep and well for a full 8 hours. I wake up groggy but it lifts abruptly within 5-10 minutes of waking.**I thought at age 29 I knew all there was to know about sleeping meds both OTC and prescription. I thought I was fucked after my decade long run with H and methodone, especially with sleep. Currently I take absolutely NO opiates or maintenance meds, just Doxepin at night. Give this a try before you give up! It is non addictive in the traditional sense and has helped the heaviest of users.P.S Just so everyone knows, if you are an opiate addict and in a pinch, loperamide (immodium) and most heart burn meds like Zantec (300)mgs ) together will allow the loperamide to cross the Blood brain barrier. It will take away 80-90% of your WD symptoms. You will need to take a dosage of lope upwards of 30mgs + .I hope this helps and wish you luck.

{"comment": "I am new at this, so here is my rant.Some little tricks that helped me...- vitamin C gummies- I took that max mg you should take daily, about 6 gummies. There is a lot of inconclusive evidence about C but I wanted to try it anyway.- Vitamin B complex/ multi-vitamin- I researched each vitamin in my supplement and what it does, it may be mental, but I believed it helped my body and brain. Different vitamins can restore cell function, help brain restoration, restlessness, leg cramps, lethargy... I took a page of notes I should find and start sharing in threads for the scientific explanations. I would discuss with a doctor or the pharmacist because taking too much of particular vitamins could do damage to your body (spoken from a pill abuser, but we are trying to be healthy, right?)- Antidepressants/ Xanax- I am prescribed them regularly but through my addiction, went on and off. I made sure I took them every day. The xanax (.5 mg) helped significantly for me, lay in bed and actually relax. I have never abused my xanax script and only use them if I think I really need them with the exact dose.- Lots of water- for my first 3 days cold, I forced myself to drink. I wanted all the toxins out of me. I wanted my body hydrated to function and start healing.- Healthy foods- I cut sugar, breads, and carbs out. The body normal reacts to glucose by crashing after a large intake so I tried to avoid this at all costs during withdrawal. I ate avocado, almonds, milk, cheese, yogurt, foods high in fat and low in sugar. I wanted to give my body any chance to get nutrients. Eating may be hard, but a handful of almonds will get you a long way.- Bath/ hot shower- Somehow, I managed to get myself up, and sit in the tub. This took all my energy the first day. But I felt relief and mentally imagined the drugs seeping out of my skin. The Xanax helped make this possible too, I could relax.- By the 3rd day, I made myself go for a walk- I can't believe what a difference it makes to get in some light exercise and nature. I read various studies about being outside, sunlight, even related to withdrawal. I sat outside for an hour one day, and the time flew by. I was thinking positive thoughts, watching the animals, listening to the sounds. For someone who felt like they were  dying, this gave life to me.- Night Sweats- This is one of my favorite tricks. No matter how many over the counter fever reducers I took, it just wouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t help. I ended up sick and tired of waking up and not sleeping because of the hot to cold my body was experiencing. I put on my Nike workout shirt, the sweat prevention ones, and I slept all through the night as it soaked up my moisture and let out my body heat. I can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe how something so little, made a huge improvement on my life and sleep.Sleep- I have read numerous studies on sleep. Even, just laying in bed. You, of course, feel some symptoms physically. But, you wont be able to feel your brain in absolute distress. Sleep, as we know, promotes healing. Every time, I need at least 2 days off work in bed. If you can take off longer, than do, but don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t waste those sick days if you are not really going to try your hardest. I also, went on vacation for a week, with a friend who had no idea my habit (about 100 mg of roxy a day). I was tired, almost the whole trip, but I was laying on the beach, in paradise, sleeping all day, on a boat, surprisingly, my symptoms were minimal. I was also stimulating my brain, I was \u00e2\u20ac\u0153happy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd (I put in quotes because happy is relative) and felt little depression.*Get ready! The first day without anything, I have no motivation or energy to do anything. I needed to make a to-do list, with things to get, to set myself up for a successful hellish few days. I needed to do it while I still was using so I would actually get it done.For me, it takes about 3 days cold turkey. The 2nd day is always the worst. By the 4th, I am ok to do my normal day activities. The tiredness stays with me longer, but I run and drink coffee to try to tick my brain. I recently tried taking subs to get through withdrawal and they worked like a miracle. One day, my 2nd without, I was handed a tab, put 1/4th under my tongue, and went about my regular day. I was hardly able to sit up and walk around to get a glass of water, then, 15 minutes later, I feel myself? I couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t believe it. After 5 days of that amount, I stopped and was myself. After a few days of low subs, I can come off and feel fine. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s then, trying to not make the mistake and reward myself for going a while without any pills. I personally, couldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t tapper down with pills. I see how it would work with withdrawals, but I know I would be lying to myself if I bought them to spread out.

Have tolerance over the years (ten) and am definitely dependent. I can't use many other drugs - have tried 15-20 alone and in combination. It's methadone and one dopamine agonist. I can't take either regularly without issues I want to avoid.My hope is to stop the opioid, reset my receptors,  go without any drugs for a couple weeks (and be sleepless for upwards of a month - oh joy) and then alternate the methadone with a dopamine agonist.For about a year, I've used a DA 5 days per week along with 5-10 mg of methadone; I used 25-30 mg of methadone the other 2 days. In the past month, I've successfully used a DA for 14 days without issue (but my doc doesn't want me to take it longer than that) and I kept the methadone to just 5 mg.  My doc added gabapentin to help deal with insomnia - I only take it when I take the DA. I have oxy, tramadol, and maybe a few benzos left from past efforts to control the movements.Seems like my options are:1. Switch to a shorter acting opioid for two weeks, then stop.2. Switch to kratom for two weeks, then stop.3. Reduce to 2.5 mg methadone for week or so, then stop.4. Just stop directly from the current 5 mg methadone.5. Ask my primary care doc for permission to see a psychopharmacologist (or some other doc ????) and see if the doc will use drugs, such as Subutex, to help, then immediately stop the Subutex.  I currently see a movement disorder specialist and he is great, but few of his patients use opioids, and he doesn't typically deal with tolerance and withdrawal.I am a bit reluctant to tell my primary care that I am dependent - I don't know if there are issues with dependence being noted in a person's records,but I already have lost my insurance in the past because I took an opioid.  In the US with the HCA, maybe this won't be an issue...but I also don't trust that a new Congress and Senate wouldn't eliminate the act. Also, I have heard that only doctors who treat addiction can use Subutex or Suboxone in my state. I don't want to be go through that if I can avoid it. Maybe that is silly to be concerned about?  I just want to see if resetting the receptors will change the disease state or reduce needed meds - to do that, I have to get through the dependence and I want to do it in a safe way that doesn't cause me too much anguish*.Any thoughts?  Thanks.*Long ago I went through benzo withdrawal prescribed by a cavalier doc who thought 1 mg would be easy to stop as I'd only taken it a few months.  Hah. The first week was spent in full-blown withdrawal and the remaining 6 months really sucked  - I really want to avoid such as thing again.", "date": "21-07-2015", "time": "12:46", "datetime": 1437482760},

{"comment": "Phenibut, in doses of 2000mg or so, has helped me during severe, debilitating opiate withdrawal. While it doesn't help some of the symptoms, I have found it calms the RLS which is my worst symptom every time, and always allows me to sleep, sometimes too much, sleeping 15-20 hours at a time... Which is a godsend during withdrawal. If you can sleep away most of the early stages of withdrawal, why not take advantage, even if while awake you're like a corpse walking in circles.Also, while this isn't advisable and really doesn't help in most cases, I would buy OTC Tylenol #1 and take 13 at a time every 24 hours (3900mg APAP, 104mg codeine). This is more the desperation aspect kicking in because what is 100mg of codeine going to really do when you take several hundred mg of Dilaudid daily, but still, psychological it would help. I did, however, overdose on APAP out of desperation a few times and went to the hospital to get checked out. I had taken more than 10grams of APAP within 24 hours several times and fortunately didn't have any liver failure but I consider myself lucky. This strategy really didn't help as such a small amount of codeine as I said was not enough to plug up my opiate receptors after such a heavy habit... It's just that desperation we all know about.But Phenibut. If you can't get Xanax or Klonipin, get Phenibut. It will give you sleep during the worst part of the early acute WDs, and help with the God forsaken RLS.PEAVE AND LOVE, and opiate free days ahead to all.", "date": "06-08-2015", "time": "01:44", "datetime": 1438825440},

{"comment": "I'm on day 3 of a cold turkey and self chosen detox. As of recent, my DOC has been fentanyl HCL - blotters and powder. I've battled with H, oxy and pretty much any opiate / opioid I can get my hands on for more than 10 years..off and on. I've been blessed with a great job which has allowed me the freedom to splurge on any narcotic I want. I've always been in control...or so I thought. My narcissistic attitude of, \"I can control this, or It's not a problem because I can afford it,\" has blinded me. I've become an asshole to my family. My two kids, both under the age of 3 (and another one the way) have dealt with my mood swings, my lack of mental presence as well as my selfish ways. I have let them down and they don't even know it. Withdrawals, well, they suck. RLS, the shits, the sweats, my uncontrollable yawns and watering eyes as well as the feverish feeling. The depression is probably the worst. My decision to quit has been one of the most humbling choices I've made. These drugs have taken complete control over me and I can't allow it to happen any longer. To keep my withdrawals at a manageable level, I'm taking 10mgs of lope twice a day, a handful of vitamins as well as xanax and MJ to sleep. It's far from a solution but does help. This addiction is very real. The wake it leaves behind is also real and in some cases, damage caused is irreparable. I've read many blogs and postings of people in similar situations. They inspired me to try and tackle this demon head on. If this reaches anyone and helps them do the same, this posting is a success. If not, these words I leave here will serve as a reminder to me. I'll look back often to read this and flood my mind with these feelings I have in this moment. I trust that will help me continue to press forward and leave this chapter behind.

PM Drs pumped me all the way up to 4 80OCs (eventually OPs, meh), and 240 30 Roxy and 120 15mg oxy a month.. Well granted I was dating the RN he liked but even after I broke up with her always gave me extra shit for no reason. Anyway long story short I tapered myself and used the RDD in Michigan to get off everything. It worked well. Was 100% about 6 weeks later and out for the worst of the WD.. Well after 2 years clean circumstances occurred and I relapsed and went on a 2 month 270mg roxy down to 160mg of OP80s the last week.. Well started going into WD, got some tramadol and took about 300 mg once or twice a day for 4 days. Tapered down to 150 last day. I got a RX or Lyrica. Day one off 150mg felt that great buzz and all WD went away. Also I have a high benzo tolerance, been on them for 11 years and I can take 3mg IR and not notice. My question is how long can I take the Lyrica without having to WD from that. It has been 8 days since last OP and 4 days since last tramadol. Right now taking 300mg every 12 hours and no WD symptoms. This is day 4 on Lyrica with Tramadol being the last opiate 4 days ago. Just looking to get clean again and any help would be appreciated. Scoured pages of Lyrica/Preg megathread but couldn't find a specific answer.So I am posting here. I was thinking 5-8 days at this dose then 2-4 days at half or less. Would I get any WD symptoms from it? Any experience appreciated. Update: Day 6 off the tram and day 14 off the OPs. Upped the Lyrica doses to 450-600 days 4 and 5. Now day 6, dropped to 225 every 12 hours. Plan to do that for another day then 2 days at 75mg. Only symptoms since starting the Lyrica is some loose stools, but I take Welcohol for my chronic stomach condition so it has been manageable...

The first couple months were extremely difficult and what helped me most was talking about it and being around people who understand.If anyone just wants to talk I'm here. Reaching out is very difficult for me, but it helped so much. If you are not comfortable just know that I will not judge you or preach at you. I have no agenda other that sharing my experience and trying to help others. You need not feel embarrassed if you don't know what to say but need someone to talk to. This shit can be extremely depressing and lonely and you don't need to go through it alone....I was doing between 0.5-1g of heroin and 20+mg of xanax or other benzos daily. Went to detox, did a two week suboxone taper as well as three rounds of phenobarbital then went to rehab. It took a few months, but life has been so much better in nearly every way. I no longer have to lie to everyone, spend a fortune on drugs and wake up sick every day. I am 29 years old, married with a white collar job. Not the stereotypical heroin addict. I know there a lot of people out there in this same situation and feel alone and trapped, as I did.This rings so true for me. I was able to afford my drug habit and thus thought I had it under control. I lied to my wife and all my friends about what was going on.

{"comment": "So just a quick update, instead of original taper schedule just stopped taking the Lyrica as should have been past the physical symptoms of the opiate withdrawal. Been almost a week, outside of some mile RLS, nothing to report, just got back into my regular workout routine and doing fine. Of course I have heard of Paws with that drug so will update again in a few weeks. If any interested, here is exactly what I did, after years clean went on a 2 month bender 270mg Oxycodone/day down to about 160mg OxyContin/day. Tramadol for 4 days 150mg/twice daily for 2 days then 250 for 1 then 100. Stopped that then went on the Lyrica, started at 150mg 12 hours after last dose of tram. Then up to 300-450 every twelve hours for 5 days. Then day 6 and 7 dropped to 1 dose of 150mg. Then quit that. Almost a week out right now with minimal symptoms, more psychological than physical, but I am a motivated person that does something all the way. Now for the opiate withdrawal I would say Lyrica a miracle drug as went through the worst days feeling nothing and being productive.. One caveat is I have a high benzo tolerance and I have read there is some cross tolerance so take that into account with your own situation. Right now clean again and on the road back to succes, wish everyone the best of luck and can contact me about the RDD I went through years ago or to even see if experiencing any Paws from the Lyrica, but will update in 3 weeks if none.

{"comment": "Didn't read through this, just throwing this out there. Kratom works great to help sleep but as a Mu opioid agonist will lengthen the duration of withdrawal. You can also develop dependence to kratom. A surprisingly large number of opiate users don't know about the magic of LOPERAMIDE. Immodium. It is an opioid but has little potential for abuse as it doesn't cross the Blood Brain Barrier. It attaches to opioid receptors in your stomach which is how it helps with diarrhea. It will also help A LOT with the physical symptoms of withdrawal. They generally come in little 2mg tabs and if you have a moderate-severe tolerance you could easily take 20 mg and be fine. I have take as much as 50 mg spread throughout the day. There is no cumulative effect in the sense that while taking 4 mg is enough to stop you up, 50 won't get you any more constipated. In addition supplements can be added to help some lope cross the BBB and I have been able to even get some nice effects from it. Taking turmeric extract and whole black peppercorns work wonders.

I mean it is very good quality and I have never had this happen to me before but since I started getting from this new guy.Last edited by Thefury; 10-12-2015 at.", "date": "10-12-2015", "time": "21:51", "datetime": 1449784260},
{"comment": "^Depending on when you took the suboxone it can prevent the withdrawal for about 24-48 hours.~Hey guys, I detoxed exactly one year ago from my low dose Bupe habit and now it is time again. I have been taking Tilidine and Kratom over the last week after having my last dose of Bupe on sunday (~0,3mg) because the WD last year was traumatic to say the least (I am underweight and could not eat for at least 3 days due to the intense puking).So this time I will detox the short acting and low potent Tilidine which also contains Naloxone.I'd like to hear some opinions on that. I got Gabapentin, some Valium, Loperamide, MCP, Magnesium+B-Vitamins etc. Maybe overkill but I need to do it for real this time and could not if it were the same kind of WDs like last year. I plan to take the Diaz only on the first 3 days for sleep and then maybe some Gabapentin, the rest as needed.Thx in advance,Zerwas aka Dicktate", "date": "12-12-2015", "time": "15:38", "datetime": 1449934680},
{"comment": "Hello BL! :0) Newbie here. First, I must apologize because this is my first post and I'm not sure I'm even doing this right. [Throw tomatoes here.]I've been a lurker for 6 or so years and really, wanted to collect all of the research I possibly could before going from poppy seed tea to poppy pods, which I did about 3 years or so ago. Before I did that, I researched pods, addiction, withdrawals, pain management- homeopathic, holistic pain management (etc.) at least 8 months before deciding to advance to pods. I didn't go into it blindly, that's for sure. I'd like to share my story and experience with you guys and hope that somebody might be able to take something from it and use it for their benefit. Every little bit helps in this game! We all know that.What brought me to seeking pain meds to begin with, began about 6 years ago. I was a full-time student (with 2 teenage kids at home) and I began--seemingly overnight--to experience excruciating migraines. They lasted no less than 3 days- 72 hours of full-on pain, as if somebody were shooting me in the head non-stop. I mean the pain was indescribable. It's worth mentioning that I've had 3 kids \"natural\" and am a firm believer in \"mind over matter\". I was like a birthing Ninja, no kidding. I had that stuff under control! But these migraines made that look like a picnic. I've just never experienced 3 days straight of hellish pain with no transitional relief of any kind.So, I did what most people do: I went to my doctor. He prescribed Lortabs, as I'd expected him to (thankfully) and because I have a fairly high pain barrier, he also prescribed Fiorcet- thinking the caffeine would help too. Except the combination made me nauseous, and so he then added Phenergan to the list. I took them as prescribed sometimes, but most of the time, I took 1/2 of a Lortab in the morning and the other half in the evening so that 30 of them would last an entire month. (It's ok. You can laugh. I do too looking back.) I used the Lortab for more for a preventative measure though, rather than waiting until that wicked hell train was already crashing through my skull. And so that was my routine for about a year.And for that first year, it sort of worked. One Lortab a day is a joke, but I realized I was a war with not only my pain, but the possibility of addiction. It's just utter madness to take pain meds and not factor that very ugly truth into it, and so I always kept that at the forefront of my mind; watching my intake, persistently and vigilantly. Even so, the migraines grew in both magnitude and frequency and before much longer, I had to drop out of college entirely; which broke my heart. My children and I aren't well off, and I was fighting so hard to set a good example for them, especially. My depression grew stronger and the Lortab just wasn't cutting it. Sometimes I would be down on the couch, sobbing in pain and really thinking that I could possibly stroke out or begin having seizures from the brain trauma. Our brains just aren't created for that kind of pain for that long of a duration.I returned to my doctor and we discussed my options. He increased my dosage, and naturally, the little (Minnie Me junkie) voice inside was delighted, but I was also hesitant due to the addiction factor now increasing as well. Regardless, I stayed on that routine for another year or so. But I just didn't feel good- and I don't mean the pain only. My liver hurt, I was always nauseous- despite having Phenergan- I just wasn't at my best and I was only 40 or so! The migraines had certainly taken a toll over the last few years, but the pills weren't helping either. I began researching natural pain medication and herbal anti-nauseants, etc. I learned that ginger is excellent for quelling nausea (and dyspepsia and all sorts of other stomach disorders), and also, I learned that cayenne pepper acts as both a blood cleanser as well as a mild analgesic. So, I began taking cayenne and ginger supplements.I also learned that Milk Thistle is one of the strongest, natural liver cleansers in the world. And, Black Seed Oil (Nigella Sativa) is a virtual panacea for all sorts of things: the stuff is phenomenal (anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antifungal. it's called \"The King's Cure-All\"). But also, it's an excellentpotentiator. SO, I began taking herbal concoctions and noticed I feltbetter. Except for the pain thing! And that's when I stumbled across this place. :0) I learned about poppy seed tea (PST) and was hopeful, for the first time in a long time. I researched PST for approximately 6 months or so, and when I felt that I was educated enough on the subject, I ordered some. It allowed me the relief I was looking for, and after 6 or so months of slowly replacing my Tabs (and other pills) with the PST, I asked my doctor to take me off of all pharmaceuticals. I had learned through experimentation that I could take care of myself-- without the help of a doctor who was basically grabbing for straws with my health. He had no idea what was causing my migraines after two years. I chose a radical, self-induced regimen,. I had more energy and noticed a comorbidity going on with the poppy seeds- it put my head chatter to sleep also. Completely. I was able to focus on things in a way I'd never experienced before.After a full year on the seeds, I was able to re-enroll in college and continue working on my Associates Degree in Behavioral Science. I've always been interested in drugs since I was a young child. Not in, necessarily, but studying the correlations between the body and mind while taking various substances. And I basically became my own guinea pig. But that's ok! So did Freud, and Pavlov and many other people. (Freud, for instance, was a coke head for years. He even claimed that he posited many theories and such while geeked out of his mind on coke.)I felt the need to study drugs academically, because to be forewarned is to be forearmed. I knew at every step, addiction would be waiting. I was going to need all the help I could get. I simply couldn't \"yoga\" this kind of long-lasting pain away, however. Havingof pain medication was an an absolute must. And so I decided to get a CPC/Certification in Substance Abuse at my school as well. Despite the PST helping me throughcramming sessions, I was still being blasted with two and three day migraines. It was beginning to affect my grades, because some days, my test would be on a day that I had a migraine and that type of thing is an academic-killer.Anyway, I knew I had maxed out my seed potency for the levels of pain that I was enduring. I simply needed something stronger. I want to clarify for the record, I seldom used the seeds to \"try to get high\". Getting high was not my goal. Killing the painI simply wanted to be able tolike other people and be up and about- pain free. I wanted my life back.So I began to research dried poppy pods for pain management. For the next 6 to 8 months, I studied everything I could find about poppy pods-When the day came for me to cross that thresh hold, I was not unprepared. I already had purchased a grinder and I already had a recipe ready- ginger for nausea- whatever else I needed- I was set. Throughout any and all opiate consumption, I've kept my drug levels down. I do know that once you begin to \"kick it up a notch\" because you've had a bad day, etc.; you're already seduced. And I'm not going to say I never did that! But I kept myself in check. I wasn't careless. I want to be a doctor someday. I know the risks and I have a lot to lose- all the way around; just as we all do.I experimented with the pods and discovered what worked for me: one teacup of pod tea every morning. Now, I know many people would shriek at that, and consider it a big no no, however, for the kind of pain I was constantly being assaulted with, this was necessary to prevent them from developing altogether.Not all drug stories are negative. Naturally, our world has purposely conditioned the masses to collectively stigmatizedrug use for self-medication, but that's just ignorance and fear-mongering. Ignorance is a dangerous weapon.After 6 month of drinking a cup of pod tea every morning like clock-work- and neverincreasing my dose- I graduated from my college with my Associate's Degree in Behavioral Sciences, with a CPC/Certification in Substance Abuse- Dean's List/Honor Roll. :0) That was two years ago. I still have my morning cup of pod tea faithfully (and still, never increase the dose) and I am now only one semester away from receiving my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology. I've made the Dean's List every semester and have been invited to join our local Society of Leadership and Success. I'm scheduled to begin working on my Master's in Forensic Psychology in the fall of 2016, and ultimately, my doctorate in Clinical Psychology thereafter. I got my life back.I know all of this is one hell of a long introduction, and again, my apologies, but I say all of that to say- I havewith both poppy seeds and poppy pods, as well as my fair share of experiencing horrible withdrawals from the pods, and I want to offer what I can in the area of what helped me during my darkest (withdrawal) days of my life.  Here's my experience of those 30 days without my medicine and what I did to counterattack the withdrawals. It's not the Thomas Recipe, but these things sure made the month a little more doable.Increased perspiration, runny nose, sneezing, malaise, depression, feelings of hopelessness (not to be confused with suicidal ideations, etc.), fatigue, lack of interest, heightened desire to isolate, irritability, Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS), insomnia, death-belly, sex drive is pleading with me to save it. I don't care.1/2 of Benadryl in the morning, a whole Benadryl at night to help with sleep and help stifle the sneezing and runny nose (histamine-related).2 \"Relax and Sleep\" herbal capsules (at night only) from the Dollar Tree= Melatonin- which helps to reset your natural sleep cycle, Valerian (which is where Valium comes from), and Chamomile- which acts as a mild sedative. Combined with Benadryl, the melatonin, valerian, and chamomilefeel like 1 part Klonopin and 1 part Ambien. The stuff really helps. Also, it effectively kills RLS.Milk Thistle- cleanses the liver and helps to kick out the opiates much faster so the withdrawals are significantly lessened in both intensity and longevity.Black Seed Oil- Aside from all of the many benefits this essential oil provides for the body, it's used regularly in Eastern countries (in many medical facilities) as an opiate withdrawal medicine. It lessens withdrawalsif taken daily and proactively. Give it a chance.Diet: Fresh vegetables (steamed/roasted) with red meats (protein is so important at this stage), green tea, chamomile tea, ginger tea- basically- drink lots of herbal teas! You will not be disappointed, and yes, they help tremendously. Green tea is loaded with antioxidants that repair damage to the body on a cellular level.Multivitamins: Again, SO important.Ibuprofin- 3 in the morning and 3 at night- faithfully.All of the above.All of the above.Rage-face. Get used to it. It's going to be your constant companion for another week or so. Depression lessens. Sex drive has died and gone to hell. Sneezing almost gone entirely, runny nose is better too. Still feeling fatigues, malaise is still there too, but not strongly. Sex drive is starting to pick up a bit. Noticeable increased appetite. Emotions still all over the place- a car commercial could make me cry. Alas, there are good days here and there too.same things.Significant improvement in mood, laughing easily- things are actually freaking funny! Things are evenagain. Especially sex.Feeling tinglies all over my body- almost as if it's vibrating- it feels like pure energy rushing through me and I realize that this is what it means to feel ALIVE. Happiness comes easily and I catch myself smiling while I'm driving. Hope is a constant companion. I feel stronger than I have in so long, both on the insideoutside. I want to take walks and take photos of things again and I have a new burst of energy to write music and sing. I can literally feel the endorphins flooding my brain- all by themselves! :0) I feel like a child again.********************For any of you who are reading this, please know that yes, withdrawals are pure hell. (You know this. We all do.) But you absolutelykeep your vision of \"week 4\" in your scope. Death-belly and malaise and rage-face, etc.- it doesn't last forever! Only a month or so of it and then I promise, your head is clear and heart is full of good stuff again and most importantly, you get your self-respect  back. You get yourback.Part of succeeding here is knowing your triggers. Don't date your triggers. ;-) It's easy to look the other way and fall (seductively) right back into it. When I was going through weeks 1-3, I seriously had some pretty scary thoughts. I really didn't think it was going to get better. Everywhere you go, there's a grey cloud above, but again- it doesn't last, and by week 4- you're on the other side of that river looking back at the last of your former self going under...it's ok to let him/her go.They say that withdrawals from poppy pods are some of the worst  that a person can experience (besides Methadone). I'm thinking this is true. ;0)No matter what type of addiction you may have, and no matter just how hopeless those withdrawals are making you feel, please know that the sun IS going to shine again and it's F-ing beautiful.God bless!And thanks for letting me share. x", "date": "12-12-2015", "time": "23:58", "datetime": 1449964680},

{"comment": "My remedy for major opiate withdrawal (eg. Heroin or fentanyl or oxycodone) without something like methadone or suboxone is the following:1. Multivitamin and lots of water2. Get your hands on some Clonadine. .2-.3mg does the trick for me3. Throw a small dose of a dissociative in there like ketamine to temporarily \"dissociate\" your brain from the painful withdrawal symptoms. (Eg 30-50mg of ketamine HCL, maybe make a nasal spray with it! I have and it works well for me)4. Throw in small doses of a antihistamine like Visteril or Benedryl every few hours to reduce the chills5. Last but most importantly...Kratom. Lifesaver for opiate withdrawals. Acts as a sort of kind of opiate but adequately reduced withdrawal symptoms. Reach for some Bali or Red Vein Borneo, mhmmIf all else fails and you still feel like blowing your brains out , get some (legal) codeine syrup. In my state, some \"mom and pop\" pharmacies sell 4 ounce bottles of Codeine and Guafenisin syrup in limited ammounts without a prescription! The bottles I get have 236mg of codeine in the whole bottle, but a lot of Guafenisin in them too so take it easy with it! Get some sprite and jolly ranchers and you got yourself some makeshift Drank. Codeine is an opiate though, so I would personally use this as an absolute last resort, and sip it slowly over the course of a day....or two! Make it last. I'd reccomend this for the worst part of the withdrawals (1-3 days without an opiate), and again only if you feel absolutely terrible.Last edited by QuantumSuicide; 05-02-2016 at.", "date": "05-02-2016", "time": "01:43", "datetime": 1454636580},

How fast you stop those depends on how many you took to feel not sick. The lope doesn't have the cravings that opioids do, so it's not hard to taper.

{"comment": "Hi,I'm not sure where to post this, but I just want to get it down so I can hear some feedback.  I've been addicted to Poppy Seed Tea for a while. (~5yrs on/off).  I got clean from it cold turkey the first time, but that only lasted for maybe 2 years.  I've quit suboxone CT at a high dose before (~8mg/day).  I stupidly started suboxone during what would've been a relatively easy Roxy withdrawal.  Quitting subs lead to Poppy seed tea (because it was \"legal\").  Knowing what I know now, I think PST is ridiculously hard to WD from.  This time around, I've been using for about a year. My dose is pretty irrelevant, I think, because I have no idea how much Morphine/Codeine et al, I've been ingesting.  I've been taking ~1.25 lbs. of strong seeds to make my daily dose.So here is why I'm posting...it's time to stop again.  I decided to meet with a Sub doc and tried to induce after 40 hours since my last dose.  That lead to precipitated withdrawals...started at 4mg, then 8mg, then 12mg...and nothing.  Crushed, I made a quick .90 lb batch of PST. (I only did 1 wash vs. my usual 3 washes).  This basically eased the withdrawals and helped me get through the day and even sleep all night.  I wasn't \"fine\".  I was BRIGHT red and had hot flashes, but I could walk around, which I needed, because we were going away for the weekend on a camping trip.  Being a husband and father, i had a lot to do...I couldn't just lay around and wait it out (not that that's any easier).  The next day I actually felt OK when I woke up.  I made the mistake of trying my suboxone again with similar results (though not quite as bad as the day before)...with no relief at all, I ended up taking 16mg throughout the day (the last 4mg once I noticed I wouldn't be sleeping).  So this night, I had to get up and leave the camper with diarrhea about 4 or 5 times.  I was actually glad to be getting some of the toxicity out of my intestines (as I assumed that's what lead to my precipitated withdrawals----the drugs lingering in my intestines without being \"evacuated\" enough in the 40 hours since my last dose).  I drank a whole bottle of benadryl and a whole bunch of tylenol PM's etc., which didn't seem to do anything, but I did seem to maybe sleep for 2 hours from 4am-6am...Had to pack up and head home the next day (yesterday).  With only 12mg of subs left, I dosed 4mg in the morning around 8am...and then another 4 around 11am....this time, around 38 hours after that PST dose (that I had hoped would not have mattered, but it did).  Still no relief, I broke down AGAIN and took a .50lb of seeds to make 1 wash of tea.  Rested for most of the day.  I drank 4 beers throughout the afternoon/evening and still wasn't sure if I would sleep, so I took 6 tylenol pms (stupid move)...this made me snore and my wife thought that meant I dosed again because I didn't snore when we were camping...not sure why I didn't snore the 1st night camping (maybe the beer helps cause it)...Okay, so today is Monday.  The sub doc called to check on me.  I told her what happened, and she promptly dropped me.  he told me she would call in 2 weeks of 8mg subs as a \"courtesy\" and then I was on my own.  (Fwiw, I called the doc after induction telling her about the precipitated withdrawal caused....she told me to up it to 12mg for that day).  When I told her I had used 12mg avg. over the next 2 days, she dropped me without disucssion.  Basically hung up on me, and told me to call back with my pharmacy phone number.  This hurt.  I was hoping she would work with me.  My plan....my hope was that I could stabilize on 4mg of subs at induction and taper off over 2 weeks.  When the induction didn't work, I didn't know what to do (they worked so well for pill wd's)....So , here I am....about 22hours since that last .50lb dose off PST.  I'm managing right now.  luckily I can \"work\" from home...I have 4mg of subs left, and hopefully that doctor actually called in the 2wk script to my pharmacy.  My thinking right now is to try taking Loperamide once the withdrawals start to really kick in again (probably before that to be honest, as they take a long time to kick in)...After that, I want to get to a point where I can get through a safe 4mg induction of Suboxone...I just have NO IDEA how long to wait...48hrs?, 72hrs? 7 days???  This shit is so ridiculous that I half way wish I would've just been using heroin so the Subs would have worked...I'm looking for advice on what to do over the next couple of days.  I had considered a taper plan with PST, but that will only prolong things and force me to keep lying to my wife.  on top of this, my companies new fiscal year is just starting and I have to go to Vegas in 8 days, for 2 days of conferences (including meeting my new boss)......Sorry for the looooooong post here.  Mods please feel free to move this.  I don't know where it should go.  I am very interested and hopeful for any advice I can get from here.

{"comment": "So im in a similar situation as you but instead of Furanyl Fentanyl im on Acryl Fentanyl.I was taking between 10-20mg/day - intranasally. But have in the last week tapered down to only somewhere in the range of 1-5mg/day, I redose every 1h - 2h as if now. But I can easily go 6h without any major withdrawal.The worst I get is the nerves, I cannot sit still or lay still for long.I will start of Buprenorphine this week, either wednessday or friday and I will take a good 24h between my last dose and the dose if Bupe to avoid acute WD's from the two mixing and crashing.How are you doing right now mate?", "date": "07-06-2016", "time": "05:45", "datetime": 1465278300},
{"comment": "Subs are a miracle drug, but not a cure all. You will still feel some residual withdrawal symptoms and need to plan on dealing with those!! Gabapentin, clonidine, low doses of benzos, DXM, and marijuana all come to mind. Depending on what your style and needs are. Sounds like your doctor and you didnt fully go over the plan. Did she prescribe anything else? Usually docs light to write 1mg clonidine and 5mg ambien or meds like those to go with the suboxone script.A general rule of thumb is... Once you've hit 4mg of suboxone, if you take another 4mg and are still\"not feeling\" it then you probably wont feel anything from taking more. There's usually a huge difference from 1-2mg, then a big difference from 2-4mg, then a slight difference up to 8mg. At least for me, past that is a waste of suboxone. Very few people actually need that high of a dose.The best advice i could give you is to get from the seeds to something like hydrocodone before you jump off to suboxone. All the different alkaloids in the PST probably make things more difficult. Idk how feasible that is for you... Good luck", "date": "08-06-2016", "time": "01:38", "datetime": 1465349880},
{"comment": "I had a similar experience to this.  I also use PST and got a hold of some subs a few weeks ago and tried to kick.  I waited around 40 hours and dosed 4mg and it sent me straight into precipitated WD.. I read that you can take more sub every hour to get through the precipitated WD.. that is a load of  B.S!  I took like an entire 8mg that night and had the worst night of my life. I ended up dosing PST and am preparing for another detox. The best thing to do if you get PWD is stop taking sub and wait it out. I'm guessing we have to wait at least 72 hrs or until we have scored a 26 on the COWS worksheet. I found an awesome induction guide from Mr. Robert 325 online.  Start of with real low doses of sub like 2mg. I will messsge you the link to his guide.

{"comment": "I am currently only about 12 days off heroin, but I think I am done this time.  I have quite many times before, but always knew in the back of my head I wasn't done.  Sometimes I was off for months, but I have never felt like this about it.  Finding the right anti depressant has made all the difference for me I think.  Anyway. After I got  through withdrawal, I had a few nights of cruel and teasing heroin dreams as normal, but on the third night of dreams I dreamt what has so far been my final heroin dream. I was too close to passing out to enjoy the high, which may not make sense to all users, but that is always how I felt about heroin: I had a sweet spot where I got lots of euphoria and could still function to some degree, but if I went beyond that I was too numb to even care I was feeling well, and I could almost feel how close I was to death and how I wasn't having a full experience.  I dreamt I was too high like that, making a fool out of myself essentially, dumping the rice I was attempting to eat into my lap.  Only for a split second did I wake up with the normal feeling of \"yay I have heroin oh wait GOD no that wasn't real\" and I quickly became happy it was just a dream, because I was acting so shamefully in front of important people, and because I didn't want to set my heroin withdrawal back and suffer more, I had done that too many times before and was sick of it.  This is a preface, but that struck me as so different, the runny nose hadn't even gone away.Maybe fixing my moods to some degree was the only factor that made this heroin withdrawal so different, but my attitude toward the experience was also completely different.  So I want to share this, in case it could help anyone.Going into it I focused on not being scared: the fear of of how bad I would soon be feeling is awful, and I am sure focusing on it too much just makes things worse.  I was not successful, I was terrified, but I made sure to at least fight it as much as possible by staying busy.  I made sure to physically exhaust myself as symptoms started on the first day not using, as I think the body high you would normally get from pushing yourself in exercise can help your body readjust, although obviously in withdrawal you cant expect it to feel good.  Plus anything that might help you be able to get just even 10 minutes of sleep you wouldn't have otherwise becomes so precious when sick.The next day the real suffering started.  About 10 mg of lope to help just a little with the shits, a bit of DXM, and ashwagandha to help my body adjust, and an aubsurd amount of tums, but no expectation of overly significant help, this is the time to suffer.  Soon the time when every moment is more bearable is approaching.  Acceptance I deserve to suffer for some of the things Iv done while high and to stay that way.  A growing sense of humor which came in flashes, seeing myself from above, vomiting while shiting on the toliet, what absurdly self defeating attempts to feel good could have resulted in this almost cartoonish picture of suffering?  The fucking noises I am making.Another day of it.  Almost starting to feel something that's not physical, but emotional, actually caring about the regret a bit more deeply, and the realization that suffering is the human condition, so I am rejoining them by doing it in a way.  Of course the first emotions allowed through after numbness are regret and sadness, but being able to feel these makes me human and are also pre requisites to feeling happy at some unknown future point.The realization I can be away from the bathroom long enough to do something.  Back to trying to exhaust myself as much as possible whenever stomach and guts allowed.  Music to motivate myself.  This was a turning point.  For a moment, I felt something I liked without with heroin for the first time.  It reminded me of what it was like to be able to be moved.  Remembering when I used to drive myself on with a totally different kind of energy, a spiritual power.  Feeling a crazy uncomfortable energy coming out of my lower back, somewhere around one of the bottom 4-5 vertebrae.  Running hot water on that spot, trying to loosen up from there progressivly through the rest of my back.  Doing so when walking, showering, when lying on my back and holding my legs together and rolling them around.  Using spirit power as a mantra.  Thinking the feeling of restless everything was actually a positive energy I could use but just had to readjust to feeling.  Focusing on bring it out from my lower back when stretching and walking.   Rediscovering music, having just one moment in the day where I almost felt happy, getting up and trying to start the day after no sleep again,what is this day 6 I have been up?  Using the energy of punk songs and not the lizard like contentedness with whatever that heroin provided.  Spirit power, knowing I will sleep some time soon,trying to exhaust myself to make it come sooner.Since I'v quit I decided I was tricked when I forgot what it was like to feel emotions.  I had a dream I believe to be about this where I would be walking and my whole environment around me would suddenly change from the interior of a house to an open beach scene, but I would know it was a hallucination and wait for it to pass before moving so I didn't like walk into a wall or something. Just spending a good day with my boyfriend is such a deeper happiness than the contentedness I used to trade everything for. I am so thankful, almost dumbfounded, he stayed with me through all of it.Last edited by TouchN' Stuff Blvd; 13-06-2016 at.", "date": "13-06-2016", "time": "05:45", "datetime": 1465796700},
{"comment": "My name is Jessica, I am 27 years old and currently live in the WA State. Right now I am at my parent's house in Missouri. I am on day three of an 8-month addiction to oxycodone. I tried to withdraw last month but after two days I was right back on it. The symptoms were just too much for me to handle psychologically I guess. I have always been an addict, since the age of 15. I have smoked pot for over ten years, had a few years of alcohol addiction in my early twenties, (I haven't drank in years) I have done other drugs recreationally like benzo, mushrooms, excessive amounts of no-doze when I was in my teens. I was also thoroughly addicted to Tramadol two years ago. I never would have thought ten years later my life would be what it is now. I've lost so much in just under a year. I live with my boyfriend of three years, a cancer survivor who uses oxycodone and morphine on a daily basis. This is where my habit started. A 5 MG here a 5 MG there when I was having back pain due to two bulged discs. Then, of course, you need more to feel the same effect and eight months later I am riding a 90 MG daily habit. A person that used to pride themselves on having a fat bank account by diligent saving has under $100.00. All I cared about was when am I going to get my next pill. I am here at my parents house not by choice. My 20-year-old sister committed suicide on June 1st. I was high throughout the entire process begging by boyfriend for more and more before and during the funeral. He is my enabler and I am his. He left back to Seattle last Wednesday and left me with one 15 mg oxy and 150 mg morphine. I didn't find out until hours later. I suffered some sort of psychotic break knowing I was going to be going through withdraws. I contacted my other sister who lives close to my parents and she brought me over 12 5 MG oxycodone. Like the addict I am, I took all in one day even though I knew better and should have tapered like the last time I withdrew. Felt so dumb the next day. So here I am day three. Feeling so much better. The last two days have been pure hell. Thomas recipe has helped me. I have taken benzo and Ambien vitamin extra B6 and B12, gabapentin has also helped a bit. I am so so sick of oxy. I am scared to fly back to Seattle in two days. I am scared I will relapse again. I can't just take one. My mind just wants more and more. With my boyfriend still addicted and my boss also addicted, I am going back to a scary situation. I hope I am strong enough to say no. I can't afford it my body cannot tolerate another withdraw. I have basically laid in bed for the last two days sweating my ass off, cold as hell. sick to my stomach, runs, joint pain, coughing, sneezing, teary eyes, you name it. Oxycodone is the devil. Those little blue pills have ruined me. I guess I am just writing this to let people know you are not alone. There are people out there, you would not expect to be so thoroughly addicted to pain medication. I am ready to get my life back and the future is in my hands. I am looking for a sponser when I get back and I am going to attend some NA meetings. The threat of replase is too strong in my mind. I worry that I will not have the strength to say no to just one pill and then my habit starts all over again. I know I can do it. I just have to have will power and strength.", "date": "13-06-2016", "time": "19:56", "datetime": 1465847760},

{"comment": "I'mNot familiar with Robert unless he's the one that another crappier site's people treat him like Jesus begging him for help.I hear you on the one size fits all approach. I do think that it's not for everyone.However, I've been on oxy for years. I've overused / abused it for years. I'm im the middle of a taper. It's a quick taper, but for me slow, going by 1 20mg pill every single day. I'm only a few days in and already on half the dose I was on when I started (was at 15x20mg )All that to say that sometimes a long drawn out taper is more problematic than beneficial. I think for almost everyone , the best case is to taper the fastest you can without having WD.Because every day it stretches on, it's tempting to take more than your taper schedule, and you're forced to think about and ration drugs, which we sucked at and that's why we're in this position in the first place.I actually got one of those lock boxes from Kickstarter for $50 that you can set to anything and it stays locked until then. No override. I take out my dailies and lock up the rest. Or you could take out a aingle serving and lock up the rest , but I figure the more you open it the more chance u take more than needed. I would have def taken more if not for it.Anyway going back to taper schedules, it's like with smoking, many people find it easier to just cold turkey than to get the willpower to taper.With drugs I think most of us are self aware enough they would know whether a taper or CT would work better.Now, to your say 10% of severe , long term addicts, who mostly inject, and opiates have become their entire life, and lifestyle has completely changed (I think the overwhelming majority of us are functional drug addicts) those people would likely fail with cold turkey OR a taper, unless they were in at least a 90day rehab.These 10%ers if rehab isn't an option. Really should probably do MMT. At least it stabilizes them, gets them out of that lifestyle, and enables them to be part of society again. Then, after several years when they have things under control, then they could start a slow taper.

{"comment": "You are correct doing a taper with opiates like oxy or heroin is impossible for most people, with a maintenance drug like suboxone or methadone a slow taper is almost always the correct way to go, maybe a small percentage of people can't do a taper but with suboxone it is a lot easier to lower your dose and not get tempted to take more, methadone might be harder but still probably easier to taper than trying to taper heroin.Also you say the majority of us opiate users are functioning, I'd have to disagree, most start out functioning but most people who aren't taking meds for legit reasons will become disfunctioning users most of the time.  It's sometimes a long process but most of us will get to that point.

{"comment": "So I had my first back surgery at 16 years old and my second at 18. My issues started 06 at age 14. I was eventually diagnosed with bulging discs, arthritis and degenerative disc disease is my lower back. First surgery they put rods and screws in my lower back (went thru my back), second one they went thru my stomach to replace one of the discs that was still moving around creating pain. The surgeon told me if I still experienced pain after that, that I will be one of the unlucky ones that will just \"manage the pain\" the rest of my life and  that there was nothing else they could do. Of course I've been to all kinds of doctors, pain management Drs and I'm now almost 24 and been \"managing\" with my pain for 3 years on pain medication. I've tried smaller and larger doses of hydro, fentanyl patches, oxy, tramadol etc. nothing ever gets rid of the pain fully, but since my experience with oxy when withdrawals get was sooooo bad, I won't let myself go above norco. So my current prescription is 10/3.25 Norco 5 a day but I run out early every month and go thru a week of withdrawal before getting my next script.  I hate doing this to myself but it's something that is almost impossible to Not do, due to my constant severe back pain. I can't fill for another 5 days or so, so I tried the Imodium thing to help with withdrawals (RLS, anxiety, nausea in the morning so far) because I have to work most of the days I'm without my meds.

I have 8 pills left, I took last night off and am already feeling under the weather, should I take a bit at the first sign of symptoms or should I push it for as long as I can handle and take something at that point but less then what I usually do. Does any one have experience coming off a similar dose? How long and difficult will this be? What are some other tips you can give me to make this process more bearable. Like I said I didn't consider this to be a large or frequent habit compared to my friends so I didn't expect to get sick at all, so Im hoping it won't be as intense as a typical withdrawal.Thanks in advanced", "date": "08-07-2016", "time": "21:56", "datetime": 1468014960},

{"comment": "I was a really really heavy IV user, shooting a brick (50 bags) of \"summer jam\", \"undercover\" or equally fire every single day for the past year.  I've gone to inpatient before a few years back and I've also gotten clean on my own before.  Each time it was hell on earth for about 2 to 3 days no matter what I did.  This time I managed to swap my massive habit for a 4mg/day suboxone habit within one month by following these steps.  You will need access to considerable Rx but if you can get your hands on all this its worth it.  Ok here we go.  You'll need approx 30 10mg methadone pills, 60 .5mg clonodine, 5 2mg Xanax (or equiv benzo).If all goes well you should feel 100% in 2 to 3 days, however those days won't be spent in utter agony.  Instead they will be spent watching TV and doing a lot of good sleeping.  First this goes without saying, you'll want to cut your dope habit back as much as possible before you begin.  Now the idea with this method is to further dramatically but painlessly lower your tolerance with a 5 to 10 day methadone taper (depending on how many you have access to).  I could tolerate day 1/50mg 2/40mg 3/30mg 4,5,6,7/30mg, 8/25mg, 9/25mg, 10/20mg.  On days 11, 12, and 13 go back to a SMALL dose of any short acting opiate (heroin is fine).  Day 14 is the big day.  Use your own judgement to determine how much clonodine you can safely take.  Taking high doses on your first 2 days helps puts you to sleep when you usually cannot.  Take the high clonodine dose on the morning of day 14 and wait a full 24 hours after your last shot before you begin taking 4mg suboxone every 45 minutes until you feel fairly comfortable.  I found 20mg my first day to be the right dose however quickly stepped down 4mg at a time every other day until I got down to 4mg every 24 to 30 hours.  The Xanax is basically there just for emergency.  On my first detox night I took two tabs to help with sleeping.  I never needed them at any other time.I hope this helps someone out there that thinks home detox from a serious habit is impossible.  I know I felt that way for a very long time.  Now I have a month clean time behind me and I can't stop crying tears of joy every time I sit back and think about what i've managed to overcome.  The last 10 years and prime of my life have essentially been stolen from me by this shit disease.  The good news, it's preventable and we do have a cure.If there is anyone that needs help or just wants to chat PM me anytime.", "date": "06-08-2016", "time": "07:30", "datetime": 1470468600},

{"comment": "Fuck man I can't stand this shit. There is so much I need to be doing this weekend. Haven't eaten or left bed. Any priority no matter how important I'll just lay there when I'm in wd. All the extra productivity opioids added to my life is reversed with interest. I only need to hold on another 18 hours. Problem is I've never taken these fucking patches. I got a 25ug fent patch to hold my oxy habit (around 80mg) for 3 days. I cut it in half, wore the half, have been generally fine considering a cold turkey from the oxy (I'm aware Im not actually quitting, I have real nasty chronic pain and don't want to at the moment. I need to avoid severe WD).I put the first half of the patch (non-gel, like a sticky) on about 1.5 days ago, the problem for me is timing, I don't know when this stuff peaks. I can't know. I've never taken it. But it seemed to peak after 24 hours, and I am planning on taking the other half with 24 hours to go, just to play it safe, even if it takes a while to build up again, I don't want to be spooked thinking I have nothing left and it's going to stop working. Feeling like shit is better than cold turkey, which I pretty much have a phobia of now. I just feel like if I had taken the whole thing at once, maybe I would get great relief for 3 days. But I couldn't trust that it would last 3 days on my skin when a percocet runs through my system in an hour or two.Like sure I might be avoiding a bullet this time, but what about next time? It's good timing that it's the weekend or I'd be totally screwed. It's really not cool, and thank fuck for that patch I found even if I got ripped off. It's weak as hell to me (12.ug/hr fuck) but I'm gonna wear the other half 1.5 days into the first one. I feel like that is the best I can do right now because for me I've been successful tapering in the past with just percs. I give my pills to my girl. That's what I wanna do, get on track again. I have too much pain to stop and honestly if the patch didn't hold me through, or if I never found it to begin with I'd probably be in the hospital right now. I would have been bad because they don't like it if you run out 2 days early. In fact, you are further shunned as a cripple from society and denied that treatment. I mean, can you blame me that much for being stressed about a new job, and not counting my pills until it was too late, and with such a long delay in pay. I just can't handle the sickness at all and I would have headed straight there. And it would have fucked me in the long run. There is a lesson to be learned for me, with this experience.At this point, if I can't get my shit under control (I'm not getting into hundreds of milligrams) then I'll have to look into other options which was a huge fear since these work so well. But once withdrawal enters the picture, especially even interdose withdrawal, it's fucking miserable hell and I wish I never started. Sure, I don't feel back pain as much now but I didn't think the withdrawal would beterrible down the road. Wish I had never abused.Last edited by ShroomySatori; 07-08-2016 at.", "date": "07-08-2016", "time": "09:59", "datetime": 1470563940},

{"comment": "Useful aids for opiate withdrawal symptoms: Imodium, Pain relievers, Benzos, anti-depressants, anxiolytic (anti-anxiety agent), energizer/stimulant, and anti-histamine.Wonder drugs for Opiate Withdrawals: Gabapentin, Robaxin, Clonidine, any Benzodiazepine, Immodium, and Kratom.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Let me start by saying that I have suffered from addiction to opiates for 2 years now. Quitting was the hardest thing I have ever done and it took well over 20 attempts but in the end. I managed to quit. I have gathered quite a bit of knowledge of how to deal with opiate withdrawals through my exploration into many medications, exercises, and rehab/detox programs.Below I will provide any and all medications and methods of making opiate withdrawals as comfortable as possible.Pain Relief: On the low end of the scale, pain relievers such as Advil, Tylenol, and Aleve with help wit the aches and pains associated with opiate withdrawals. If you're someone with a little more access, I would say shoot for muscle relaxers (Skelaxin, Flexeril, Robaxin, and Soma) in order to stop the pain and muscle spasms dead in their tracks. Medications such as Gabapentin or Lyrica can be even more efficient in battling opiate withdrawal pain.Anxiety & Depression: Without a doubt, the most effective drug for anxiety associated with opiate withdrawal anxiety are Benzos. In fact, benzodiazepines are one of the top medications used to alleviate a range of opiate withdrawal symptoms. Even going as far as reducing cravings for more opiates. Other medications useful for opiate withdrawals are barbiturates, Vistaril (which is an anti-histamine that helps with anxiety and tension), buspirone, and even Benadryl. Once again, Gabapentin and Lyrica do wonders for anxiety as well as insomnia. These two drugs provide relief in a similar manner to benzos. This can be said for Clonidine as well. Many of these will also help with the periods of insomnia which is typical to experience during opiate withdrawals. If possible, contact your doctor about beginning a daily anti-depressant and anxiety medication as soon as possible. Depression and anxiety is very common during withdrawals.Stomach and Intestinal complications: Imodium is a definite necessity during withdrawals. Imodium is actually an opioid agonist making it closely related to the chemical compound of narcotic painkillers. Other medications, such as Bentyl or other anti-spasmodic agents will help with cramps and abdominal discomfort that is destined to happen.", "date": "09-08-2016", "time": "05:32", "datetime": 1470720720},

I plan on detoxing and I already have a good line of meds for it: loperamide, gabapentin, hydroxyzine, K-Tabs (potassium tablets), Weed, and DXM. I hope to get a few lorazepam but that probably won't happen. I was researching how the meds available to me affect withdrawal and when I came to dexamethasone I found this article. I don't understand it so I hope someone more knowledgeable can put it in layman's terms for me\"Dexamethasone has been shown to inhibit opiate withdrawal, in an in vitro model. In this respect, we suggested that dexamethasone could reduce opiate withdrawal by blocking the release of prostaglandins' precursor, arachidonic acid through protein synthesis dependent-mechanisms (1). Since arachidonic acid is released by the enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in the present paper we evaluate whether dexamethasone effect may by related to inhibition of PLA2 activity. Therefore, the effect of a neutralizing anti-lipocortin-1 antibody and a polyclonal anti-type II extracellular phospholipase A2 antibody on the opiate withdrawal in vitro was considered. Following a 4 min in vitro exposure to morphine a strong contracture of guinea-pig isolated ileum was observed after the addition of naloxone. Dexamethasone at concentration of 5x10(-5) M reduces of 50% morphine withdrawal and the polyclonal anti-type II extracellular PLA2 antibody (in a dilution 1:1000) mimicked dexamethasone inhibitory effect. Incubation of the ileum preparation with a neutralizing anti-lipocortin-1 antibody (at a dilution of 1:10.000) 30 min before dexamethasone reverted the steroid effects. These results suggest that dexamethasone inhibition of opiate withdrawal is due to extracellular type II PLA2 inhibition through lipocortin-1.\"", "date": "10-08-2016", "time": "12:56", "datetime": 1470833760},

The withdraw is causing discomfort in my lady parts so I go back and nip just enough to relax that nerve that flares up each time I withdraw.

I put 4 nickels in a coin purse and each time I go to the cabinet to get a cup of coffee I'll take a nickel out and put it in the shot glass and grab out a half tab of the codeine. When the nickels are all gone I'm done for the day. Each time I stare at the nickels and look at the clock. Sometimes I walk away and come back an hour later knowing I've spread out the time better. So, instead of 1 1/2 tab a day of 10/325 Norco for 45 days I'll be taking 2 tabs of T3 5/325 spread out over the whole day. Do You Think This is conservative enough? Is this any kind of progress?

Completely nuts and screaming. There is much worse things in life than pain and even death. A bad nerve in your body that shocks you and screams bloody murder.

I've noticed that my fear of withdrawal and expectations of suffering are very inflated compared to what it actually turns out to be.americapicker & Ruby: I haven't really slept more than 30-60 minutes each night for over a week now as a result of coming off a super low buprenorphine and xanax dose (I'm actually starting to hallucinate and am thinking of not driving until I can get a solid 4-hour block of sleep), and that's after I tapered down on the buprenorphine, and that was after 2 years of smoking black tar H every day, sometimes in excess of 2 grams in a day.  So, all of this to say that, yes, there are people here who have quit opioids, you can do it, really anyone can as long as they want to, have the right support, and the right tools.  You might say, \"but, buprenorphine is a drug!\", to which I would say, yes it is, but I haven't smoked any heroin for something like 10-12 months, and am expecting this episode to pass as well, and for me to become the same person I was 3 years ago, just depressed as hell and 20lbs lighter, and a little less wealthy.I also suggest starting a thread in Dark Side or Sober Living to help you get through.  Just the minute social interaction you get from that is therapeutic, nevermind the information you gain.So Ruby, how's that taper going?  What is your plan?  Know also that if you fail the taper, that's ok.

{"comment": "I am VERY close with many individuals who have been struggling with opiate use.  I want to share a method that has been effective for one friend who was using a bundle to two a day for about 1.5 years, before that a half to a whole for a couple years...  She was able to get on suboxone, but they told her to take 3 a day; now anyone who knows anything about opiates (and yes Suboxone is an opiate), they know that this will produce dependance.  A \"normal\" (non opiate addict) will be sick off of half of a Sub... let alone 3... so one should think about that, since most people want to eventually be off all opiates (if they want to get sober of course).  Well she did not use the docs advice; she waited till she got sick before taking the 3 (8 mg) sublingual films; the next day she went to two, with little reaction, the next day to 1, the next to a half, then to 1/4 (2 mg).  The 2 mg she has taken for 2 days, but she has also used vitamins, minerals, asprin and tylenol for body aches, that virtually did not exist till she tried to go from the 2 mg to nothing.  She used this method right off of her 1 to 2 buns a day.. so it is possible.  BUt the longer you stay on subs, the longer you will be on them, and the worse it will be to come off.

{"comment": "I have been trying to get off this shit for the last month. Using lope kratom even oxy but nothing helped. The oxy even taking 150 mg a day didn't even give me a buzz it was like taking Tylenol. The kratom also didn't have any feeling but at 10 grams helped with the withdrawal. Also 30 lope 60 mg has helped the best At not feeling any withdrawal almost 100% just the tired feeling and of course the constipation but that can be fixed with stool softener. The problem with all of these is I still couldn't stop myself from taking the drug I would get clean and then say ok I'll try one more time and then I'm stuck using again everyday. This drug is tourture because I haven't slept through the night in about 3 weeks. Waking up every 2 hours not to use but just awake. Then the last time I wake up usually 5am I have to dose. So I read aboutAgmatine. I highly suggest anyone trying to get clean to research it. I take 6 pills 3G and its helps about 80%with the withdraws. The best part is it blocks the opiods receptors in your brain so if you dose all day u will prob just feel the first dose if any and very faint at that no rush like usually and not even get a buzz the rest of the day. So taking these pills kill your drug from working and that triggers you to think if the drug doesn't work why even take any because you will feel the same. So mentally you will quit if you keep taking these pills because your not getting high with your drug.Good luck guys I hope this will help save some of you.

{"comment": "Let me teach you an AMAZINGLY effective trick that has worked for me. I was an opiate addict for 23yrs & through my dozens & dozens of attempt to kick, i found a system that usually works incredibly well. But bare in mind that no two bodies work the same. Warning: This method is by no means medically safe & anyone who attempts itadoes so at their own risk. But seeing as how we're junkies or we wouldn't be having this conversation, what's the harm. This only works for those addicted to standard full agonist opiates ie morphine, heroin, oxy, opana, dilaudid, etc. Thjs will definitely not work for suboxone, methadone or subutex (buprenorphine) addicts. Ok? Here we go.Wait until you are in moderate to full withdrawal fr your normal opiate & take enough suboxone to feel comfortable. Once you feel comfortable wait an hour aad take a dose of a benzo large enough to give you a slight buzz. What's important is that you feel relaxed & comfortable/comforted after that anxious withdrawal you just went through.Temazapam works best since it's designed for opiate withdrawal but klonopin works well to. If xanax or Valium is all you can get then do that. Once you feel like a normal human being begin your new life as if physical addiction is now officially behind you. Because if you do this right, it is behind you. Exercise that day and every day for the rest of your life. On days two & three repeat the suboxone/ benzo routine precisely as before, reducing the suboxone quantity if you can do it & still be comfortable. When you wake up on day 4 you will begin to feel the withdrawal coming on from the suboxone wearing off, DO NOT take anymore suboxone!!! Wait for the withdrawl to come on fairly strong then take whatever you consider to be a substantial dose of methadone, enough to get you pretty darn high, but not enough to hurt yourself. That much methadone should get you all the way through day four & at least halfway through day five. The real trick is on day five. After the methadone has lost all narcotic impact but before you begin to experience withdrawal, take another dose of your benzo. This time you'll probably want to take a slightly larger dose of it but of course, be careful. After this you should experience NO WITHDRAWAL WHATSOEVER. Between the days of suboxone blocking your receptors & the methadone (which tou are not physially addicted to) supressing your withdrawal symptoms, you should be near day 6 of no standard opiates & your physical withdrawal should be over. At this stage the benzo should be enough to keep you not just ok, but downright cozy. I am on day 7 of this process as i type this & i feel wonderful. I have had no opiates of ANY kind in 72 hours after 12 years of INCREDIBLY high level fentanyl/oxycodone addiction & i feel great. I should mention that i have been taking 20mg klonopin or temazapam twice daily, but besides exercise sunshine & socializing, that's all Im taking. This process has worked for me & several others i have taught it to ontoat least 12 separate occasions over the decades of addiction1ive experienced & i feel that having found it, it was moral duty to pass it on to others.

{"comment": "A methadone landing pad after a super-fast bupe taper actually does sound pretty genius to get through that last 48 hours of no subs.But did I read right...20mgs of klonopin (clonazepam)??? For 20 of temazepam yeah that's like the equivalent of 0.5mg alprazolam but is that the right figure for how much clonazepam you took?I think that needs an edit.But pretty sound idea in my mind aside from that. Thanks for sharing that!Good luck in the days to come, and be prepared to fight cravings! Be careful not to rely on the benzos too long (that snake bit me and the benzo kick was worse than the subutex after a year kick, seriously).  If you MUST get high I recommend cannabis (eating it has a heavier effect thus more satisfying to me) and non-benzo, non-opioids like the muscle relaxants carisoprodol and cyclobenzaprine, or DXM.They won't set you back but will solve that problem of \"I dont know what to do with myself if I'm not high\".

I wonder if anyone thinks that I can get by ok without Colonidine,  I want to get it but I don't really want to to talk to a doctor about this.Is it a lifesaver???  Will it make a significant difference? Is it worth the risk of going to my doc and having them \"mark me\" and treat me like a total scumbag? I am really terrified of heart palpitations, I know that's the one thing that will make the anxiety unbearable.  Do they help a lot with those??As a side note, I am African-American and I am worried that they wont listen to me or give me anything to help (some will think this doesn't make a difference but in my experience it almost always does).

{"comment": "Hi again Brently:  I just responded to your other post on the tapering thread here on BL.  I found that clonidine extremely important when I went c.t. in 2012.  I caved on day 4  of my c.t. withdrawal from oxycodone because of my rapid heartbeat and went to the ER, which had a huge copay, by the way.  All they gave me was a 5 day clonidine patch, that they administered.  OMG!  It was amazing. my heart slowed down gradually, the anxiety melted away, and I was able to complete the withdrawals.  I stayed clean for about 15 months, but once again, caved to pain, and now here I am again.So, if rapid heartbeat is an issue, and you know when my adrenals kicked in my heart rate and blood pressure spiked.  This time, I am prepared  I called my GP and asked him to call in a script and he did.  Again, I am older than you, and I do not have many problems getting what I need.Being that you are Afro-American I will share that many of my friends that are African American have high blood pressure.  That is what clonidine is primarily for.  Have them check your blood pressure...you may really need the clonidine.

{"comment": "Hi Pokemama!  Thank you for your reply, here, and on my other post!  Rapid heartbeat IS an issue, a huge one.  Every time I've had a panic attack in the past has been due to my heartbeat in some way (then my mind spirals out of control..but, ya know...).  Thanks for the information, I will definitely seek a doctor's help now.As to the blood pressure, I (and my mother/hereditary) always have low blood pressure.  Not enough to cause a problem but a doctor certainly would not see a need for a prescription. I suppose I should be up-front.  I have read many say that their doctor gave them other nice meds to go along with the clonidine (however you spell it!), maybe I will luck out and get a doctor like that.  I could use nausea meds and maybe a muscle relaxer, maybe some good will come out of my honesty...lol  I don't have a regular doctor, so I'll be meeting someone for the first time, and asking a great mercy.

For instance when I recently stopped a 9 month fent binder at the peak I was doing 1.0g of bf a day I had planned on a time I was going to stop so the last few months I lowered it to .5bf/.5ff/3.0manit. I made it last about 4 days or so. I had a few subs some Xanax,clonidine, high grade herb,amitriptyline to sleep and some adderall. So I did my last bit around 4 got home around 9 ate my sleep meds some herb,clonidine and slept for a while woke up sweaty feeling like sh=!. Coming from my last experience taking a sub too early and going into full blown prec w/d for about 7 hours I was a little hesitant but to myself I want to go as long as possible until I can't take it anymore and take the sub about 52hours and only about 3 or 4 mg so about an hour later I felt OK surprisingly  ot too bad so I waited another 24 hours or so and took a few more mg of the sub about the same with the life of those I just waited for it to wear off and me feel horrible but after about 36 hours after the last sub I dint feel too bad so I didn't take any more and I was just waiting for wd and other then being a little sweaty and sneezing even after benadryl. I'm about 2 weeks from my last fent other then my stomach problems and food not tasting the same and being achey all over with no energy I'm experiencing very minimal symptoms appetite not great things are just now starting to taste normal recently . If you keep on the clonidine Xanax medical grade herb benadryl I used pepto instead of ammodium  some shatter and sleeping pills are a must in my opinion  .a stimulant for some energy maybe some test if available. I am still very surprised I don't have any ambition to do it again with how easy it was this time to transition off it with minimalI've been around it but not one thought or desire to do it.

I did my last shot at 1pm today cuz of course I couldn't make it until ten o'clock last night without spending the last of my cash on some more boy. So today I'm trying again. I got some Gatorade, gabapentin, Tylenol, seroquel, and a grip of klonopins. I already took two k pins at 7pm I think I'll drop two more and a few hundo mgs of seroquel and sleep as long as fuckin possible. Then when I wake up hopefully I can take a few mgs of sub and feel ok. I know it takes a while, last time it took a day to feel better but I dropped 8mg of sub last time. This time I'll take like 2-4 mgs at first around 24-25 hours after last shot. I'm hoping I can make this transition and feel better fast cuz I can't go back to black.

Do you think I will experience a strong setback ? At day 13, my symptoms was depressed feeling, not feeling really well in my body, a bit hard to sleep at night. Today I'm okay physically, only a bit depressed, I still feel the improvement of my condition given by my 300mg dose from yesterday, but I fear going back to day 3 tomorrow or shit like that.\"Advice plz :s ?edit : one advice : if you have time and you are ready to endure pain, plz don't go on the sub/MMT route. Ive detoxed from heroin and sub (jumping from 3 - 4 mg), and heroin was walk in the park compared to sub. Okay heroin is harder mentally and physically, but you can see improvement day by day. With sub, you are under the impression it never get better. Mental side is easier, but when you begin having HARD symptom at day 3->4 you know you are in this position for 1 week at least (and that's generally recovery position and/or fetal position if you want to play with words). And after that symptoms resolve week by week, not days by days. It's almost impossible to not relapse after 1 month of feeling bad. I didn't sleep for 8 days straight, got 1 night of normal sleep (8h), then another week of 2h sleep a night. Horrible. Never again. From what I read it's even harder with methadone (longer WD).

Been a longish term opiate user; mostly heroin, never IV, smoking it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fucked my lungs so I snort it now, which gives me a permanent-ish blocked nose.  (Phenergan sorta works to clear this/potentiate the dope).  However I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve been lucky enough to only fall into daily use a couple of times, and only for short (less than one month) periods.  For the last ~2.5 months however it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been a daily opioid regime - alternating between \u00e2\u20ac\u0153pure\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd heroin, suboxone (bupe w/ naloxone), codeine, poppy pod tea and oxycodone (just once), plus of course daily alcohol, smatterings of benzos (diazepam, etizolam), meth a few times (yuck), modafinil, some ketamine and some weed.  With the heroin (which I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d say is actually around ~65 - 80% pure; certainly much better than street or market grade stuff) I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d use from 100mg to 300 mg in a day, intransally in ~20 - 30 mg increments.  This\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be 2 - 4 days a week. 1 - 2 mg of suboxone will do the job when smack isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t feasible.  Poppy pod tea (8 - 20 pods) also works nicely to fill in the gaps; did some good gardening work this year, although it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s almost over.  Also had access to some modified release 60mg codeine tabs - easy to crush.  Two of those will take the pain away, four/five will be an ok buzz, and two of those + some poppy tea has been a bit of a revelation.  Gotta stop now though.

{"comment": "Methacodone - I said ~ 65 - 80 %. Also, I don't use heroin daily, so I don't have an enormous tolerance - hence a small amount of bupe/modest amount of codeine doing the job.  As I also said in my post above, currently this is my longest period of daily use, and 2.5 months ain't that long really. I think the \"pure\" heroin we get here (Australia), SE Asian #4, IS around that mark for purity - say maybe more like from 60% to 75-80% pure? Samples of street gear analysed in the late '90s in Cabramatta, Sydney, at the peak of Australia's heroin boom, showed an average purity of 66%.It's generally accepted that street gear these days is much less strong, however the higher grade \"pure\" you can buy in Australia is (subjectively) 3 or 4 times stronger than street/market grade gear.  So say that average street grade is around 20% these days; \"pure\" being from 60% - 80% doesn't seem far-fetched.Perhaps another Australian user can chime in here?  Maybe I'm way off, and I'm not trying to dick-size about the quality of dope I can get.  Subjectively again, it's less strong that the very potent #4 I've had in SE Asia, but not THAT much less strong.Anyway, this is probably off topic.  First day of rapid bupe taper.  Feeling fine on 2mg, had my last dose of pod tea (+some 2cb, weed and some wine - very nice combo!) last night, looking forward to being clean this time next week.Last edited by slow&sideways; 04-12-2016 at.", "date": "04-12-2016", "time": "06:30", "datetime": 1480833000},

{"comment": "QUESTION: Please helpOn Tue 29 Oct 2016 I stopped a 22 year opioid habit (mainly codeine) about 900-1,200 Mg a day. For detox I went through about 4 boxes of Valium (1,000 Mg) and 3 and a bit boxes of Tamazapem 875 Mg all spread out over about 5 or 6 days (the Valium was used up by Tuesday 6 Dec 2016 (just on a week ago now). So by about Wednesday 7 Dec all the Valium was gone. I still have some Tamazapem but probably don't need it anymore and I didn't take any last night.During the detox the doses varied some nights I would take as much as 120 Mg Tamazapem and 80 Mg Valium 3 times a day and other nights not so much.Problem is now I have no withdrawals I have started taking Naltrexone GH 50 Mg a day but I still feel like I'm not able to walk in a straight line, drive a car safely etc and I figured this should have all passed by now. Its the 11/12/16 now. In fact I've actually had 3 minor car accidents over the past two days (previously haven't had a car accident in well over 10 years). I was only driving short distances to see a doctor and get supplies from the shop. But now I'm not really thinking its a good idea to drive anywhere at all. But Obviously I cant stay like that. I was planning to be feeling fully over this and back at work by now.Any thoughts on what's happening? How long should Tamazapem make me feel drowsy for or is it something else?Thanks in advance for any help.", "date": "10-12-2016", "time": "21:36", "datetime": 1481405760},

Will just throw another question out there whilst I'm at it:  in many ways getting through WD is the easy part (although obviously it's NOT easy) - the psychological malaise that can engulf you after getting clean is a huge reason many people release obviously.  I'm wondering if anyone has tried very small doses of ketamine post-acute WD's?  Not so much as an opiate substitute as a mental health tool?

{"comment": "Yes as a matter of fact all I ever want to do is lay down in bed. It's hard to get to sleep but once I do the withdrawals are gone for a short period, which is usually my main goal-to fall asleep. I have trouble tossing and turning, restless leg syndrome, my clothes feel too tight even when they're not, loud noises irritate me, basically everything you could think of. I don't want to be bothered by anyone unless they have a remedy to help me feel back to normal. The worst experience was when I checked myself into an impatient rehab and was stuck there detoxing off suboxone for 30 days. And no, it never stopped! I didn't know at the time excersize was very beneficial, but even still it was hard for me to even get out of bed. I refused to go to the manditory groups, I rarely ate lunch or dinner, I passed on showers, you get the point. I felt like a 90 year old woman. I have been on Suboxone for eight years now and it's been a nightmare. I have a three year old and I'm a stay at home mom so when I run out I feel so bad for her bc I can barely move and keep her entertained. It's like the bare minimum. On a brighter note, all the things I've been reading on Kratom has certainly caught my attention, so I ordered 5 ounces off a really good vendor's website (Kraken Kratom) and just got it this afternoon. I ran out of subs and couldn't afford the refill so I had to resort to my old pal H. I did that and then waited about four hours and tried four grams of a red strained Kratom powder called Super Indu. My tolerance is super duper high so I wouldn't say I feel so much high as I do zonked out like I need to go to bed. I will say I've had no cravings for suboxone even during my waiting period between the H and the Kratom. Today was a good day for me bc I did not put any piece of suboxone under my tongue. It feels like I broke a cycle and I would be so blessed if it stayed this way. For us long time suboxone/methadone/opiate users one day without taking it is a huge accomplishment. Whether you're suffering or not, it's a step in the right direction. I would love to help people get off this stuff and break free of these chains whenever I do this myself. I wouldn't wish those  long drawn out withdrawals on my worst enemy...who knew a human being could feel so much pain and suffering from self induced past mistakes.Ps: I do recommend those of you long term or short term users trying to quit to go get a few ounces of Kratom and try it. I don't know if I'm allowed to post vendors here so to help you out just go to google and type in too 3 online Kratom vendors. One of them has \"Happy\" in their title. That's the number one vendor so far. The one I used was very inexpensive and good quality and showed up as number 2 on the top vendors list in the US. Also the red strains are said to help most with opiate withdrawal. We're all in this together so let's help one another out please.

{"comment": "Nah, I've never officially kicked H.I've only kicked Suboxone @ 2mg and .25mg jumps. I did use comfort meds and they did help, but I started to get dependent on gabapentin by the end, which isn't kicking dope but is still annoying.I have a friend who kicked H (1g a day when not broke) and methadone (10mg per day) by smoking lots of weed and being motivated to quit. Obviously the first week sucks but after that he says it's a mental battle and smoking mad weed was his cure.Worst case scenario and a doctor insists on prescribing you to 12mg of sub a day. Just immediately start out at 2mg or whatever gets you by and immediately taper and go through the motions for a little bit with your doctor and tell them that you're ready to quit and then they will give you the meds you want. Not the immediate results you want, but if all else fails at least you will eventually get there.Last edited by JoeJunky; 01-01-2017 at.", "date": "01-01-2017", "time": "03:16", "datetime": 1483240560},

(I hope codethyline is as strong as codeine and not stronger :/ )Can someone describe me a good taper plan ? I'm able to stay ~35h without the product with not going that much sick, so take into account I can skip days but for skipping 1 day I need 2 consecutive days of dosing (and I prefer keeping my schedule of skipping some days because I don't want withdrawaling from 8 consecutive weeks of intake).helpthis drug is fucking my life I know I'm not into hardcore addiction but that's really annoyingIve no idea how hard it will be. Last time I tried, I kicked after 1 complete week of intake (7 consecutive days - but my \"normal\" schedule before), and I finally rellapsed at the 14th day (FUCK). WD wasn't that hard but I was lethargic day 2->6 (but felt minor WD to day 14)For example, is this schedule maintainable :day 0 (tomorrow) : skip+1 : 180mg+2 : 180mg+3: skip+4 : 180mg+5 : 120mg+6 : 120mg+7 : skip+8 : 120mg+9 : 120mg+10 : skip+11 : 120mg+12 : 80mg+13 : 80mg+14 : skip+15 : 80mg+16 : 60mgIve no idea the dose from wich I can jump ????

I think they do this in order to see if there was a possible mistake and/or it was a one time occurrence...or they are waiting for you to fail 3 times(or whatever number) so they can kick you outright once they bring it up to you instead of telling you that you failed the DT the first time thus obligating them to help you before you started to fail more tests.", "date": "11-01-2017", "time": "03:30", "datetime": 1484105400},

Thus my other perscriptions im on to treat manic depression/bipolar disorder, PTSD, and dissasociative disorder. i hate rattling off the shit that i deal with, but im at peace with the psychological problems, ive been dealing with them since grade school. i'm coming to terms with the possibility of the extent of my physical problems slowly but surely. I know it sounds idiotic, but if what i have becomes any type of terminal problem i'd just rather not know about it right now.anyway, now that thats out of the way, i comprehend that your doctor may approach your pain issues in a different way, thats why i mentioned all the protocal can differ with multiple varials - age, condition, geographic location, etc. All i can speak of is how doctors go about pain treatment around me, in the Chicagoland area. If your doctor is more flexible, and willing to prescribe you exactly what you ask for, then good on you. I mean that sincerely. and my current doctor doesnt seem to ponder my words as \"bullshit\" because i happen to be more than qualified to recieve potent painkillers, and i'm also an abuser of said painkillers. I'm sure i'm not the only one with that mindset, i was a heavy drinker for over 20 years, until i replaced that with various opiates and benzodiaprines. Now i dont drink because honestly, i dont feel the need to, after graduating to pills, i've just replaced one addiction with another. things arent always black and white, i think most of us thrive in the grey area in life.", "date": "11-01-2017", "time": "17:06", "datetime": 1484154360},
{"comment": "i agree, though it took me a long time to get results, as of a few weeks ago i finally did. The closest thing i can compare it to is the liquid morphine they shot me up with when i severed my ring finger years ago. Problem is, most of the poppy seeds you find at the local stores are garbage. If you can find the brand that comes in 8 ounce bags, that shits powerful! Thanks to this site i've picked up alot of pointers on how to get the most out of poppy tea. I can make a batch out of 1.5 lbs of poppy seeds (3 bags) that can last up to 2 days depending on the batch of seeds.Everyones tolerance is different, good to know you can \"bridge the gap\" with relatively low cost ingredients from your local supermarketbest of luck to youLast edited by SnapzWagner; 11-01-2017 at.", "date": "11-01-2017", "time": "20:48", "datetime": 1484167680},

{"comment": "Hi,Does anyone know if it's possible for marijuana to precipitate codeine withdrawal? I was on codeine for about 4 months, it was the only thing that helped the severe sciatica I had from a herniated disc that left me practically bedridden. At one point (only for a few days) I was taking 10 x 30mg codeine phosphate pills a day, as the 8 max I'd been told to take (2 pills 4 times a day) wasn't covering it and I was getting a lot of pain at night.Eventually when the pain lessened I dropped down a 2-3 pills a day with seemingly no problems, and even had 1 or 2 days a week where I didn't take any. When I went back to work my stress levels ramped up and I found I liked taking them to get that little warm rush and calming effect. I was still only taking maybe 2 in the morning, 2 at night though.Just after Christmas I had 2 codeine about 6pm then went to my friends and she offered me a joint at about 10pm. I only smoked half as I'm not a big weed smoker and don't like the taste, but come 11pm and I was suffering severe abdominal cramps, sweating, shaking, nausea, horrible diarrhoea (once all the constipated crap had been pushed through first, gross I know). That went on for 2 days, then the anxiety started, and the restless legs. God, the horror of restless legs! Never want to go through that again...I realised then that I hadn't taken any codeine for a few days and that what I was going through was withdrawal. The restless legs is only mild now, but still dealing with the depression/anxiety. I just don't get:1. How I can have become addicted on the small, irregular doses I was taking for the last month or so of being on codeine2. How withdrawals (the stomach cramps/nausea/diarrhoea) could have kicked in so soon after my last dose without the marijuana maybe playing a part? Something to do with receptors or something maybe?", "date": "21-01-2017", "time": "13:18", "datetime": 1485004680},

I figured that I would manage the rest.Anyway, fast forward 12 hours after my last dose of oxy.  Only two days and 6 years clean.  I'm in immediate withdrawals.

I don't know whether to call this a slip-up, I mean in a way I gave in but the pain was so bad that I was crying.

If you want to avoid strong WD, you can :- 1 -> test a major dose of sub some hours after your last DOC intake (\"major\" compared to your addiction), lets say 8mg, then nothing after. The goal is to profit from the long half life and the fact your addiction was light hoping that everything heal with no WD (rationnal abstract : the brain repair at the same speed sub go out of your system.). If I fall back in addiction this will be what I will test. The only difficulty of this method is getting 8mg sub, no more no less. Less : you will perhaps have some symtoms, more : you will binge and make a new problem.- 2 -> Like Ive done now because of lazyness (didn't want to stop at this moment) : take sub no day by day but each 2 or 3 days. You should be able to do that if your addiction was light before and you want maintenance. There is paper on that on google but that's about doubling the dose in order to take only the other day, what I propose is more light dose each other days, wich should be manageable, and will make you avoid extreme sub withdrawal (this is not something you wan't. If I should re-endure what hapenned 4 month ago, I probably will never stop sub taking. Jumped from 4mg, 2 week with 7h sleep (I downed 30 xanax 0,25 for that night of sleep but I was at the extreme, this was this poor action or hospital for fluid & sleep), 1 month for the head beginning this feeling will not be like that forever, desydrathed, hallucination (probably due to sleepless night), total 1,5 month of horror)Last edited by no_id; 05-02-2017 at.", "date": "05-02-2017", "time": "12:46", "datetime": 1486298760},

After about 2.5g/ day the therapeutic effect wanes and the efficacy drops in relation to side effects. As for myself I notice I don't enjoy cannabis when I'm on too much GP. Not to mention the dependency that develops at the higher doses.Check out the links above because we are kind of derailing this thread away from opioid withdrawal.

{"comment": "Not sure if this is the right place to post but here goes nothing...I have been using PST fairly regularly for about two years now. It has gotten to be my DOC...when the seeds are good. And lately they haven't been which has been causing some problems for me.I had total crap seeds for about two months which forced me into a long, long, LONG withdrawal. I used high potency kratom to help with it but still had awful night sweats, stomach issues, depression etc., etc. The kratom is expensive and had it's own set of dependency issues. Finally got a decent bag of seeds and all was good for a few weeks (my usual dose is 1 cup a day, rinsed twice).I got my second usual 5 lb bag from same vendor but something is really wrong. The quality is for crap again but what's concerning me more is the new side effects.I am having terrible stomach issues. Not just diarrhea but crazy heartburn, nausea, and vomiting as well. I got some of the kratom i usually get (which usually has me feeling great) and i haven't felt it at all. Other symptoms are: waking up in tge middle of the night (even on ambien and clonopin), weird, disturbing dreams, depression, and of course, lack of motivation and depression. I have quite a bit of MS Contin 15 and some Embeda 20 and taking that doesn't seem to do anything. (Actually, it probably is helping as I've certainly had worse withdrawals.)My questions are, 1. after months of low potency seeds my tolerance (fairly high) went down. Would that one good 5lb bag have upped my tolerance so much to have these withdrawals? It just doesn't seem right that two weeks of barely decent seeds would have my tolerance up so high again. 2. How much MS Contin do I need to combat these withdrawals? I'm crushing and soaking them and then either drinking or plugging about three pills every eight hours or so on top of taking three Embeda every day. 3. Why do these withdrawals feel so different? I've gone through WD from all types of opiates but these stomach/dream/heartburn symptoms are kind of different. 4. Why isn't the kratom helping at all? I don't know if I can list brands, but this is the head shop stuff that comes in a gold package with two capsules. I am not feeling the kratom AT ALL. 5. Sleep is really weird. I fall into an incredibly heavy sleep for only a few hours at a time with vivid, unpleasant dreams and wake up unrested, body aching, mouth open, breath like death, and CONSTANTLY dehydrated. I'm taking ambien and clonopin. Should i be taking something else? Finally, 6. Could this batch of seeds just be no good? I mean, not just low potency, but have some weird stuff in it? I've had a hard time locating any decent seeds for tge past few months. My regular, usually great, vendor has become very unreliable.I have been taking all the other usual stuff like lope and other OTC stuff. I know the drill.

{"comment": "So I'm trying to get clean from opiates, finally and for for good, after about fours years of fairly steady usage. My story begins likes most: chipping with percs, then on to 30 mg blues which I'd divide into quarters, then halves \u00e2\u20ac\u201c always just swallowing the pills btw. Fast forward to last month when I was up to between 150 - 200 mgs of oxy (blues) a day.Over the years, while waiting for pills, I'd use kratom 2 or 3 times a day, then I discovered suboxone, and would use that, maybe 4 mg or 2 mg, while waiting for the blues, but never for more than a week.On March 31, I decided enough is enough. I ran out of blues, almost out of money, and decided now is the time. On March 31, I swallowed my last pills, procured 2 and a half 8 mg sub strips and began my detox journey. On April one I took 4 mg sub with the mindset to start tapering immediately.Was using sub every other day and also a fair amount of alcohol and some MJ. A week after my last pill, I was a little high and drunk... I looked at my two kids (4 and 2), and just started sobbing. I then came clean to my wife that I need help.While tapering down to .5 of sub I was hating the way it made me feel. I was in acute WDs every day and miserable. I decided subs are evil, and can't fathom being on them for YEARS like some people are...so I googled around and stumbled upon a site with someone suggesting using short-acting opiates to \"rip the sub off the receptors\" and then detox from the blues.It made sense at the time, and I only bought 15 from the dealer, who said goodbye to forever. I texted my other source for pills as well and told him I'm out of the game. But after 3 days of using the blues and no sub, I'm regretting it. Just so confused.Here's where I'm at: Today is Friday, I last took 1 mg sub on Sunday. I started on low dosing of blues on Tuesday, but of course ramped up to 90 mgs yesterday. Today I woke up feeling WDs, so have been on blue pieces spaced out throughout the day so far.I have a total of 2 mg sub broken up into about .5 pieces, eyeballed. I have 4 blues left. I have a fair amount of kratom. I have MJ and booze, of course, and access to anything OTC.I want to be free of this opiate addiction nightmare and vicsious cycle. How would you advise me going forward based on the above? Any help/advice is greatly appreciated. I'm a 41 year old father of two, btw, and I need to be present and well enough to care for them, and I need to be functional for work. I've decided I am NOT going to buy any more pills or sub strips to get through this.

{"comment": "do you remember what kind of doses you were taking? i've been taking pretty large amounts of tramadol (around 800 mg). i know that's dangerous but i've been also taking klonopin on top to hopefully minimize seizure risk. if it's a dose dependent thing, i don't want to take the risk, and might just taper off the tramadol as much as i can, get past the acute heroin withdrawal (now 48 hours without shooting up!), but do it quickly enough to hopefully not to get hooked on tram, whose withdrawals i've heard are particularly terrible. then i'd switch to sub if i feel like i need it.man, i started taking opiates because i was very dissatisfied with my life, and they made me a much more outgoing, fun to be around person. i even got a girlfriend, the first relationship in something like 5 years. i actually got 2 girlfriends, one on each coast (i'm not a sleaze, they knew that long distance stuff wasn't for us, and we were free to explore when were were apart). they both dumped me by the way, in the same week too. what a bummer. they didn't know about my drug use, but they definitely noticed me gradually turning into a zombie.anyway, i really envy people who are capable of natural happiness. i'm much worse off than i was to start with. opiates taken over my life and i'm more depressed than ever. it's definitely time to quit--i just wish it was easy to stop as it was to start.thanks for the advice guys, tho the past two posts contradicted each other, so i'm still sort of confused.", "date": "21-04-2017", "time": "20:29", "datetime": 1492806540},
{"comment": "If you have been taking that much tramadol, I suggest you take a more reasonable dose prior to switching onto the buprenorphine.I have combined large (as in whoppingly large) doses of tramadol with buprenorphine before, similar to what you described (for some reason I seem to remember the number 700mg), although I truly do not recommend it. Having something like clonazepam in one's system is better than nothing but hardly a safe alternative to taking a more reasonable dose of tramadol.Tramadol is not and does not act similarly to full agonist opioids, which are what you need to worry about when it comes to precipitated withdrawal. Start your own thread specifically on this topic if it is not addressed satisfactorily here (so you are feeling more comfortable I mean).The reasons you started to use opioids sounds precisely why I was drawn to them. They are an incredibly effective remedy for malaise and dis-ease, just as long as one can find ways of keeping use from getting out of hand (I would say rising seizures taking as much as you are is getting a bit out of hand TBH).Hope you are able to find some success getting to a more balanced place with your use!", "date": "21-04-2017", "time": "20:57", "datetime": 1492808220},

{"comment": "Congrats on your decision, KraziKat. I've been in the same place, detoxed inpatient (I'm middle-aged and was too naive to know that wasn't my only option. Traumatic lesson learned!), but because being locked down for the first (only) time was so unpleasant, I toughed it out and fast-tracked my taper to 3.5 days on minimal suboxone. I agree that subs are rough and not ideal for everyone. For reference, I have a rare, severe form of rheumatoid arthritis in my spine that's caused an unfortunate dance with pain management methods. When I kicked inpatient, I went in on 125mcg fentanyl patches, and 150mg/day oxy & hydro. Yikes. Seeing that # again still shakes me up. I had an old school doc that was obviously liberal with the meds. Well, since I'm in Utah, the holiest, puritanical state of the Southwest (no doubt ground zero for anti-opioid mania) they yanked his license. Leaving me without the epic amount of opiates. Apparently, I was on the lower end of his patients in the amount prescribed, so I was able to go to another pain clinic, provided I detox and start over. That was November 2016. I was scared at first, but I'm so glad I did it. That was an insane amount for a 36 year old with a long road of worsening symptoms yet to travel.Fast forward to last week: I had a rough, rough month of pain/anxiety from life and I threw all self-control out the window. I went through my entire month of 10mg oxy, 5x/day in 2 weeks, with 2 weeks of SOL, nada ahead of me. I battled the demon monkey perched on my back hard enough to have 3 pills left to taper. Of course, that was a joke. I took the last of it on Friday, 6 days ago. However, there's a light at the end of this tortuous tunnel. I had 2.5 days of decent discomfort (yawning, sneezing, nausea, EM EFFING UBER RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME), all of which were manageable enough with OTC Imodium, dxm cough syrup/Benadryl, lots o' edible MJ, and alternating Flexeril and Zanaflex muscle relaxers for the RLS/knocking me out enough to sleep a few hours. By the 3rd day, the most unbearable symptoms of yawning and kicking were substantially better. Days 4 & 5, I just felt mildly fluey with low fever, achy and generally run down. Day 6 today, and I feel completely human again. & with a stronger resolve to take my meds as prescribed because it's not fun otherwise. So, it's possible and not unbearable without subs.

{"comment": "Congrats on trying again, I'm sure you'll be successful this time. 1/2 the battle is mentally prepping yourself. Even with subs, it's not painless. You just have to constantly remind yourself that the discomfort is temporary and a hell of a lot better than waking up in w w/d and the rough lifestyle that accompanies most heroin use. Besides subs, your next best friend is Imodium, ibuprofen, & any form of fluids with electrolytes. I had a monster tolerance when I detoxed the first time, & figured out that I was super dehydrated on the 3rd day. 3 Smart Waters later, I felt so much better. A good chunk of my misery was from dehydration (also the reason that separates a normal hangover from a class V bangaroo, FML  hangover).Taper schedule*: MOST IMPORTANT RULE, don't take your first sub until 24 hrs after your last use. Be in decent discomfort from w/d before starting. Precipitated w/d is a bitch. Day 1, cut the strips into 4. Take a 1/4 piece (2mg) every 4-6 hrs. The longer you wait between, the faster this process goes. Just don't let yourself get miserable. I'd try to 1/2 your entire day's dose, every day, including the times you take it at night to sleep. You don't want to start a sub habit, so the faster you kick, the better.

{"comment": "Just a quick addendum to everything No Time just said which I agree with:Check out the COWS (clinical opioid withdrawal scale). You want to score at least a 25 before it's safe to induct and you may want to wait even longer for good measure. Remind yourself that relief IS coming; it's worth it to suffer mildly for an extra few hours than to rush it and be in pwd (which is far more painful) for several hours+. So its not exactly a \"24-hours fits all\" scenario. You may need more time.Also, for induction, I prefer using even less than 2mg at a time; as a prophylactic against pwd, I recommend taking 0.5mg every 30-40 minutes until well. This will ease the bupe onto your receptors in an orderly manner and won't clash with any lingering opioids still in your system.  After around 1.5-2mg and a couple hours have passed, if you haven't gone into pwd yet, you can be reasonably certain that you won't, and will be able to take a larger dose at that point, if necessary (like 2, or even 8mg).

{"comment": "Hi allI'm new but wanted to chime in and ask for opinions regarding my current WD. Quick background:I have been an on and off opiate user since 2003. This was when I had to undergo my first back surgery. I, for the most part, used very low level pain meds prior to and following the surgery for about a year in total. My real struggle started in 2015 when I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I underwent a double mastectomy and started chemo. During chemo I began having massive issues with my back. I had re-injured it prior to my cancer diagnosis but managed to stay away from narcotics. What we found was that the chemo has attacked the fast growing cells in my disc and was causing massive pain. This lead to a spinal fusion during which they ruptured the dura causing my spinal fluid to be depleted....And another surgery. Then a prevetative hysterectomy. So after a total of 5 surgery in 1.5 years, I am on some pretty heavy doses of pain meds. Prescribed 2 20mg oxycontin daily and 4 30mg oxycodone daily. Now, I go thru this in about 2 weeks. Occasionally, I will get about 5 75mcg fentanyl patches a month but that's a rarity.I have been out of meds for 4 days but have taken about 12 mg of lope first time yesterday, 50mg of vyvance (prescribed) and around 1mg of tizanadine (prescribed) 3x during the day and around 4-6mg at night for sleep. I have had almost no WD symptoms. Just feelings of lethargy but not overwhelmingly and a mild case of waking more often through the night. I have been able to sleep an average of 6 hours per night. I've been able to get up and move around. No bathroom issues (even prior to taking lope on day 3) no mind funk, no real cravings, extremely minor sweats, no runny nose, no anxiety or any other symptom that I usually get in a massive way every time I run out of meds. I have gone thru WDs 8 - 10 times and have never found it to be this easy. Even with all of the meds I have taken this time.So here's the ???...What is going on? The only difference I can think of is that I have given myself 2 B12 shots over the past 2 months and started on a massive dose of vitamin D.Anyone that has an opinion I am totally open to hearing any and all.

{"comment": "You may want to try sodium ascorbate (vitamin C) which unbelievably works great to eliminate withdrawal symptoms. I took it for three days, starting with one heaping teaspoon (about 5 g) after my last dose, continuing every two hours until diarrhea sets in, then back off the dose some but continue to take the sodium ascorbate every two hours. You won't feel great, but if it works for you like it did for me you will not have any severe withdrawal symptoms at all. You need to take it every two hours, which means you may need to wake up every two hours. For me, the withdrawal symptoms would wake me up at about the two hour mark, then I would take the sodium ascorbate mixed with a little juice, and the symptoms would subside in about 20 or 30 min. I would not have believed that this simple substance would work to eliminate withdrawal from oxycodone (100 \u2013 120 mg per day) but it does. You can purchase a bottle of the powder on Amazon for about $25.I was taking oxycodone at this level for about four years. I have some ibogaine here at my house that I was going to use, but decided to give the sodium ascorbate a try. It worked, and in my opinion is easier than the ibogaine. Certainly less expensive.I have quit oxycodone and Suboxone about five times in the last 10 years. I have never tried heroin, but I understand that oxycodone is basically its equivalent. Obviously, I have trouble staying off opiates. However, for what it's worth, the sodium ascorbate has proven to be the best and easiest method to quit that I have found. Previously, I would have said ibogaine is the easiest method. DO NOT use ibogaine if you are taking Adderall or any other amphetamine because it will mess you up. I found this out the hard way the last time I used ibogaine and I was a mess for about a month.", "date": "01-05-2017", "time": "20:14", "datetime": 1493669640},

With my family history of breast cancer and my current Rheumatoid spinal condition, I'm possibly looking at a similar future. As far as easier wd, firstly, I'm glad it's not as bad, you deserve a break! It could be any number of things. I take a pretty heavy duty immunosuppressant (I refer to it as chemo-lite), and it seemed to me that on the days I took it (I take it twice a week, not daily), it seemed to offset my wd symptoms a bit. Has your chemo changed? Maybe the immunosuppressant serves to suppress some of the wd itself. Withdrawal might be partly an immuno response? You also might want to check out the loperamide thread on here. I had some lingering PAWS and was able to abate that with loperamide. I also found that tizanidine was the most helpful for the anxiety and RLS. Your personal chemistry will continue to change throughout chemo and after. It may have just changed in a way that offsets wd. Or, you're in constant discomfort from the chemo and spine problems that wd is less uncomfortable in perspective now.

{"comment": "Hi. I have been searching through the posts for awhile. Lots of good information here. Finally I have decided to post. This is my first attempt to kick this horrible habit and I am quite scared. Its all started with hydrocodone, and then oxycodone. I have a job that I can not be seen nowhere near the pain management clinic. So I have been buying of oxys from my friend. Well its a very expensive habit even from my job. So my binges were consisting of 5/30 roxys a day for 3 to 5 days, then 3 to 5 days on tramadol (I have a script for that with my physician), when there is no blues I would have a week of 3 oxy 60s a day, then again some time on tramadol till I can get the next batch. And all that has lasted for about 2 years. So my question is am I addicted to all of that or if switching between those meds made it easier to quit? I have 2 strips of suboxone, full bottle of tramadol, about 600/300mg gabapenthin, about 5 lunestas and a week off work. Please help me to use this smart and painless.

{"comment": "I'm coming off a H habit of about .5g to 1.5g daily snorted mostly and sometimes smoked. I tried to go cold turkey a couple of weeks back but couldn't handle it, mainly because I had people around the house all the time. So I got some methadone and took it for 5 days and then stopped (it is now my second day without methadone and I took anywhere from 50mg-100mg daily for 5 days). Today is 7th day after doing H last and two days since last methadone dose. I don't feel \"sick\" but I feel...not great? I'm sneezing and yawning once in a while and sometimes feel hot but other than that (a bit of GI discomfort but nothing bad) - do you think I will face WD from the methadone after another day or so or do you think I'm over the worst of it? I still have some methadone left if needed to taper further (about 160mg left still) but I don't want to stay on this stuff.Any ideas or advice or what to expect and should I continue to taper with methadone until I get to 5mg or 2mg?EDIT: I took about 20-25mg earlier and feel much better. I want to stop it here but I'm not sure if the methadone I have taken up to this point will cause WD's?Last edited by EheheDurgs; 30-05-2017 at.", "date": "30-05-2017", "time": "07:52", "datetime": 1496130720},
{"comment": "Hi, I'm new here but not to addiction. I had serious drinking and a slight drug curiosity at a young age and was tossed in rehab 30 day's by age of 12. Played around off n on til I hit 20 and had my two kids and decided to quit everything. Lost two husband's to Alcohol, and losing\u200b the current one now as well, and although I blame myself for may parts, it has little to do with my using but everything to do with me wanting to get clean. The plan is to get clean and make a run for it (whole other story, prolly need another forum lol) I need a level head. I have a pain disorder that has landed me on pain meds for the last five years. I have tried my hardest to take them as directed by my doctor. Current is 10mg oxycontin twice day and 5mg hydrocodone twice. There's a ton of other meds I've been prescribed over the last five years for pain but most did nothing leaving me with the oxy and hydrocodone. Anyhow the problems started when family members wanted my meds and started trying to borrow against theirs ( I'll give you two of my oxycodone for one of yours, when I fill it. It really started screwing up my system, and two 5mgs is not the same as a 10mg of oxycontin and I would just end up short and in pain. Or I'd want more of the instant oxycodone and would trade my hydrocodone, which to me is the lesser of the two. Regardless of me repeatedly telling everyone this it continued and I just majorly struggled to get back to my normal dosing this week, but I am still short 5 of my 10mg so I'll skip the bedtime ones which doesn't give me any noticeable signs/symptoms.So my questions are, what can I expect? I've been reading on here,lurking for over a month, and most use much more than me, so I find it hard to really get an idea what to expect. I know I'm on really low dose but I've been on them five years, is that going to make wd worse than if I had taken higher does for say a few months? Also I bought 4oz of Kratom powder, and was hoping to use this a few days to get through wd but have no clue how much to use. Seem most use a fairly decent amount, but I don't know if I need as much since my habit is low?. I have no support at home, can't tell anyone my plan either, so I have no down time. My biggest fear in wd is vomiting, if I can avoid that at all costs I think I can get through it. Ive read mixed things about this and how bad it really is. Is there going to be major vomiting and can it be avoided? I have severe insomnia now and have for last for years. I sleep two or three hours a night, nothing works, my doctor is always trying to give me something different to try so I'm not worrying about that.  Anyhow, it took me a month to work up the nerve to post, hopefully it's in the right spot.", "date": "30-05-2017", "time": "14:02", "datetime": 1496152920},

{"comment": "Someone may have already posted this method, but I thought I would put it out there just in case.I've been using opiates on and off for 20 years and this is what I have found to be the best method for curing your physical opiate addiction. This will not help you with your mental addiction. If you don't want to quit or have the mental support you need, you WILL relapse. This will only cure the physical part.First let me start with some do not do's:DO NOT replace one opiate with another. Methadone or Suboxone withdrawal is a living hell. Methadone withdrawal is also the only opiate withdrawal you can actually kill you. Methadone clinics are also the worst place you could put an opiate addict. I made so many drug connections at Methadone clinics. When I visited a town I didn't know and I wanted opiates, I would stand close to a Methadone clinic and talk to the people coming out. I'd score in about 15 minutes. I've had drug dealers push stuff on me while I was in line for my daily dose. It's a really bad scene. DO NOT GO. Both Methadone and Suboxone make heroin or oxycodone withdrawal look like fun by comparison. I was trapped on Methadone for five years and the same for Suboxone. Nobody tells you how bad it will be until it's too late.DO NOT use Tramadol, Kratom, other opiates or huge doses of Imodium to \"ease the withdrawal symptoms\". You are only delaying the sickness. Some people will take huge amounts of Imodium because it is, basically, an opiate. It just has no high because it cannot pass the blood brain barrier. It's like taking Morphine to cure your Heroin habit. People will get off their opiate of choice, say Oxycodone or Heroin, only to find they are now heavily addicted to Imodium which you then have to withdraw from and it's a very nasty withdrawal.OK, now the method is simple:DAY ONE - Take your last dose of opiates and record the time so you know how long it's been since your last fix. I start the stopwatch on my iPhone and let it run until it hits the appropriate wait time, which is 24 - 36 hours. You're going to have to wait AT LEAST 24 hours or you will get really sick. The bigger your habit, the longer I recommend you wait. I never go over 24 hours, but we all have different bodies.If you don't feel at least a little sick, you run the risk of going into what is called \"precipitated withdrawal\" when you take the Suboxone and you DO NOT want this to happen. It happened to me the first time I tried this method because I took a huge dose of heroin, only waited 18 hours and took my first dose of Suboxone all at once. I thought I was dying. Most people will say wait until you score a 26 on the \"COWS scale\". Here is a link so you can score yourself:I wait until I'm around at least a 20 on this scale and that seems to be sufficient.DAY TWO - Now that your wait is over and your in mild withdrawal, it's time to start the Suboxone. Your first dose will be 8 mg. I cannot stress this enough: DO NOT take all 8 mg at one time. I take 0.5 mg every 90 - 120 minutes and build up to 8 mg on the first day. If you take it all at once, you may not like the results of your body trying to purge the opiates in your system all at once. It's best to let your body ease into it, letting the Suboxone SLOWLY push the opiates out of your receptors and replace them. This is the hardest day, but it's still much less painful than cold turkey withdrawal.DAY THREE - On the next day, you can take the full dose at one time, but today it will be 6 mg, not 8 mg.DAY FOUR - Now you are on your third and last day of Suboxone and you will take 4 mg. DO NOT take any more Suboxone after this point.DAY FIVE AND SIX - Lay in bed for a day or so. You may feel fine by this point and you may be able to go back to normal life. I've seen some people have this reaction, but not me. I need two days. You will feel crappy but you won't be vomiting or going through full blown withdrawal. After a couple days you should feel pretty normal. Tired, but normal.Once you start feeling sick you can take a variety of medicines to help ease the transition:Ibuprofen or Aleve - Some people prefer Aleve, I prefer Ibuprofen. This will help with things such as leg and joint pain.Imodium - I know I just told you not to use Imodium, but I was referring to large doses to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Simply take it AS PRESCRIBED on the box to help prevent diarrhea.Clonidine - This is a prescription heart medicine. It's commonly given to opiate addicts who are in withdrawal and it works wonders. Basically, it slows down your heart rate. This is the one that will help you the most. It's not hard to get if you have a doctor who knows you are going through opiate withdrawal. I've never had trouble obtaining it from a doctor.Benzodiazepines (Klonopin, Ativan, Valium, Xanax) - Any of these will help a lot. They are used for anxiety and insomnia.Marijuana - I can't tell you how much this will help a variety of symptoms.. especially pain and insomnia. It can also really help your mental state. Studies have proven this to be very effective, even in very small doses.That's it. When I was taught this method, I didn't believe it would work. It sounded way too good to be true, even though I knew the source was very informed on this subject. Then I tried it and WOW. What a difference. This is all that Suboxone is really good for. AGAIN, don't take Suboxone for more than three days. A Suboxone addiction is the last thing you want.The last time I did this I was up to a minimum of 150 mg of oxycodone or 15 bags of heroin a day. No matter how big your habit is, this works wonders.If you ever need advice or an opinion on your specific situation or just have questions, please feel free to contact me at.Good luck!Last edited by matt13104; 04-06-2017 at.", "date": "04-06-2017", "time": "21:07", "datetime": 1496610420},
{"comment": "^^ no offense but 150mg of oxy does NOT = 15 bags of heroin, which is about 1.5grams! Not even close! 150mg of oxy is much less in equivalent and is really not that much oxy in perspective for many people who are opiate-tolerant. I could make .5grams of heroin last me the night whereas 150mg of oxy would probably not do anything to me at all (and I'm talking if I took all 150mg all at once). In fact, 150mg of oxy might not even be enough to stave off withdrawals for someone who has a 1.5gram (\"15 bags\")/day habit of H!I'm also confused my your post. You say: \"But then you go on to suggest suboxone dosing...you do realize that suboxone is an opioid? Granted, it is synthetic and also has antagonistic properties; howeever it IS an opioid.Don't get me wrong, suboxone can work great but suboxone is opioid replacement, plain and simple.I also feel that the taper you suggest could be greatly reduced and still be as effective (if not more effective/less risky).When I was taking 240-320mg of oxy per day (all in one dose), I took suboxone for about a week or 1.5 weeks and tapered aggressively and it worked great, the only real issues I had were sleep problems and sweating (as the oxy left my system).I waited until I was sick in withdrawal (I think it was about 36-48hrs after my last dose of oxy) and took 2mg of suboxone. After an hour I felt much better but not fully better so I took another 1.5mg or so and I felt perfect an hour after that.So for my suboxone taper:1st dose: 3.5mg2nd dose/day of sub use: 3.5mg3rd: 2.5mg4th: 2mg5th: 1.5mg6th: 1mg7th: 1mg8th: .5mg9th: .25mgand that was about it. I did not have any issues after that but I also started taking oxy again shortly after this successful taper, which is really the risk that will always be there.Starting a suboxone taper at 8mg is probably way too high and unneccessary. For a 150mg oxy habit, 2mg would probably be enough though everyone is different. Bupe is pretty powerful stuff.And yes, taking suboxone too soon after last dose of an opiate/oid agonist will cause severe sickness.Also, the more you play with trying to use suboxone to come off of opiates/oids the more difficult/less effective it becomes.Having said all that, I am very curious to test a theory that if one were to take say 24mg or 32mg of suboxone in one dose after waiting until full withdrawal and not taking ANY more suboxone after that again, would this work painlessly? The theory is that the high dose and long 1/2 life of suboxone will hold one off from getting sick for enough time for the short-acting opiate/oid to flush out from the system and the single high-dose stack will slowly remove itself from the system as well. (<<-- NOTE: I'm not suggesting anyone try this but it is just a theory that I have always been curious about).", "date": "04-06-2017", "time": "22:36", "datetime": 1496615760},
{"comment": "I would love some advice! First things first, I'm a major asshole and fucked up after months on Suboxone. Got myself down to 2mg, and was enjoying the stability in my life, boyfriend and I were happy, the whole bit.THEN I decide it's a good idea to use. So I take a small, two/three day's 'vacation', smoke my last tray on Sunday at 3am, and then wake up at 12pm thinking, for some fucking reason, that the last time I used was 11pm the night prior, having forgotten about the 3am occurrence.Of course I go into precipitated withdrawal (for the first time ever), and freak. Out. And again, because I'm an asshole, I go and pick up a of H to try to alleviate the symptoms.It either worked, or the PW passed on it's own. I don't know which.That all happened yesterday around 12pm. I have been using very sparingly, but I have been using. I last smoked a rather large tray at 12:30pm.My question is this, if I stop using H now, and wait until tomorrow morning at 7am (19 hours, or longer if necessary) will I then be able to take my subs and not get thrown back into PW withdrawal? Or what? Does anyone have any experience with going into PWs, smoking heroin, and then successfully getting back on Suboxone.Any info or advice is much appreciated. I don't want to do anymore dope, but I'm afraid of PWs and all the while I've work and a home to keep up.Please tell me if I just need to wait the standard amount of time, in conjunction with COWs, or do I somehow have to wait longer because I used H after going into PW??Thank you all so much!", "date": "05-06-2017", "time": "22:02", "datetime": 1496700120},

I can say that Tiliden is relatively weak in comparison to Oxycodone and I would choose it over the Tilidene.

He is as a result very cautious... smokes pot tried shrooms and wants to trip with me. I worry cause I know he's done coke and Mdma before (more than I had done at his age, although I was smokin pot constantly). He will totally be cool with watching over me since he's interested in trying DMT himself so I'll report back!Okay so I did it twice, an hour apart. The first time was essentially fucking the universe. Letting me know everything would be okay, it was so reassuring.The second time was more of a slap in the face by that same spirit who felt like she was fucking me an hour earlier. It was very humbling and the first thing I saw was a group of tortured souls reaching out for me. It reminded me of where my chemical dependency could take me in the future. Just be careful it's really healing though. I wouldn't do it again for a while.By the way each experience, especially the first one took the withdrawals away for around an hour.Last edited by ShroomySatori; 05-07-2017 at.", "date": "05-07-2017", "time": "20:14", "datetime": 1499285640},

{"comment": "Thanks for clarifying that. I almost fucked up today, when I woke up in pain and discomfort at 4am in the morning I had this idea of screwing the whole thing by dosing myself with some poppy pods and I wasnt far to actually doing it. I even went to the nearest spot where bunch of poppies grow but some f*cker harvested the whole lot before I got a chance!!! I ended up taking amphetamines on trust from a nearby house and gave up on opiates. Now Im glad I did that, coz if I took any opiate my withdrawals would be back to square one tomorrow and I would have to go through the same ordeal again!Now Im convinced that the high is not worth the withdrawals, at all. You get high, you're good for that first hour and that's the best bit finished, but once you're addicted and withdrawing it's an all day struggle for days, I mean minute after minute you're stuck with this pain and it got so bad for me that the second day of withdrawals I couldnt even sit up on my bed. I was so thirsty but felt too sick to get a drink from the kitchen.Im not doing that again... Although I had some good nodsProper nods, where you nod off straight after the dose kicks in and you're just nodding through those dream like landscapes, you even hear the music playing but somehow you're too indulged in a nod that it doesn't connect with you.

{"comment": "So the kindling thing , I've always wondered , would it be smarter to just stay on the said drug rather than detox and relapse detox and relapse ?Kinda interesting I've always thought about kindling.I think another aspect to kindling is when you detox a few times, you mentally become weaker.So the next time you start kicking you don't have that same mental outlook from the start where you're thinking \"okay I'm ready for anything let's handle this get clean\" like I did my first few times kicking.Your first time kicking you're ready mentally because you wanna deal with it, it's a first time experience.But once you're deep a few years into addiction it gets old, and you experience withdrawals a bunch of times maybe not full detoxes but enough 12 hour periods that add up where you just don't wanna deal with it at all.Maybe that's how I am , but anyways it's 7-8 hours since my last shot gonna give it my all this weekend wish me luck", "date": "08-07-2017", "time": "05:28", "datetime": 1499491680},

{"comment": "Thanks you two. I've been struggling about what to do with my oxy script, and that was good to hear because it is my present plan to avoid a relapse but still have them. I can go get them with my (very close, cute, trusted) friend, and give them to her right away to hold onto for me. I don't really want to take any of them myself, unless my back is killing me and I really need a 5mg perc or something... like if I'm going for a hike with her, for example, and will be gone for a while I might request a pill so that I can enjoy the steep exercise instead of hurting myself. It's like, I don't reallythat though you know? And it was so awful at the end. Mixing lines of H and C together, meth in withdrawal, like I was fucking myself. I could just as well never take them again.I can't believe it myself Cf! I'm really at the prime age of my life and I have to get going, it's now or never. My friend is in a similar situation (but completely different, she's not a junkie) and she's very motivated as well. We spend a lot of time learning together, it's wonderful to have that while I'm in recovery but I'm also building a serious relationship for my future with her. I'm going through a lot more than opiate withdrawal as well. I met this girl quite a while ago who I really like a lot and it has been wonderful. At first it was completely exhausting to keep up with her, even getting out of bed and driving a short way to her place took immense effort. She has been really understanding and I've been completely honest with her.It took around 2 weeks until my testosterone levels were back to normal, I heard it can take up to three months. Just been getting laid a lot and that definitely will whip one who is withdrawing back into shape. I smoked about a gram of DMT over the month, and it was always during sort of crisis scenarios, when I was really confused and thinking about relapsing or doubting myself. Every time I used it was really insightful, but the last time blew all my other trips away. I really did have an epiphany. It took me hours to calm myself down and I am still processing what happened and thinking about the trip every day. If one is considering Ibogaine, perhaps they could give something like DMT a try too before diving into that one (Ibogaine sounds hardcore to me - I have a gram of it, but I didn't use it at all while recovering).I'm sleeping and have a lot more energy now, but I'm still not back to my normal self. Now, it's nausea and extreme anxiety / full blown panic attacks that are messing with me. I'm really proud of myself but I know it hasn't even been 2 months yet. I need to keep an eye out. I went through such hell that I never want to experience that ever again. I think I've been more exhausted figuring out this tricky female than the post-acute symptoms.

{"comment": "\"The likely explanation for these observations is that opioids raise levels of cortisol, a hormone that plays a primary role in stress responses; and cortisol, in turn, raises the level of activity in the mesolimbic reward system\"along with \"...methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone act on the same brain structures and processes as addictive opioids, but with protective or normalizing effects.\"I don't know, there are some decent parts but honestly there is a lot of bad info too. There is a lot of research data which points that opioids tend to lower cortisol, so either the paper is worded in a very weird manner and I'm misinterpreting it or it states things which are definitely not \"clinical truisms\". While buprenorphine and methadone have their place, they can equally be the problem itself, so calling them protective/normalizing can be outright dangerous.The part about noradrenaline is pretty important though, it's one of the reasons clonidine is such a godsend. The paper makes it seems though that clonidine by itself could substitute opioids and while it seems to play with the endogenous opioid system it doesn't quite cure opioid withdrawal. When we start making assumptions that more or less same factors lead to addiction/dependence in every case it's easy to start looking at things in a skewed manner. I'm pretty sure there are many others too who never took opioids for 'intense pleasure' but to self-medicate another issue, which in turn often gets exacerbated when opioids are removed from the equation. Pain being an obvious one, but there are many other reasons people end up taking opioids. They are a very convenient way of managing stress that results from various life situations, the problem being that you really don't tend to develop natural (endogenous) ways of coping with stress when you are taking them. Therefore depending on the individual, the endocrine system for example might be way more crucial to addiction compared to the mesolimbic, in my opinion at least. The HPA-axis has a diurnal rhythm and curiously cravings and withdrawal symptoms seem to vary simply with the time of day as well, independent of environmental stressors, triggers, cues etc. Not to say the latter don't play a part too.In the end, it's all about what we actually do with the research data that counts. For me personally, pleasure, reward, motivation, it's almost irrelevant when compared to training the brain to cope with stress, step by step. For someone else it could be equally important to unlearn the reward seeking behavior associated with opioids. Quite a complex matter. For whatever reason I'm not bothered at all if there are opioids within my hands reach when I'm in acute withdrawal, or if someone else is using them in the same room and when I get cravings they tend to be for anything which isn't an opioid as long as it lowers the stress I'm experiencing (or at least I believe it would do so). Resetting withdrawal by taking opioids is a very stressful idea in itself, so I don't need to put conscious effort to avoiding it, unless the mind tricks me into believing I wouldn't be resetting or setting the withdrawal process back significantly.Many ways to look at it, best keep an open mind I suppose.", "date": "09-08-2017", "time": "13:43", "datetime": 1502286180},

It was not like opiate withdrawal, but today I am feeling suicidal and I know it's from that disgusting fucking garbage, and it was excellent coke too. I did too much for too long. That stuff wrecked me, I can't handle stimulants. I would never touch coke again and I have no idea how people do something that makes you feel like such fucking garbage after doing it for just 24 hours. I'd sooner shoot heroin again than ever go near even a little bump of that shit.At least it was a warning sign right? I did get that from her, but I am furious at myself. I haven't been able to enjoy life ever since, well I have, but there is this constant feeling of complete fucking garbage permeating my body and mind. When I was just beginning to feel wonderful again, I feel utterly hopeless now. I feel like slitting my wrists to be honest, I want to pick up some scissors and slash myself for doing something so fucking stupid I think perhaps I might be prone to hard crashes right now because my body is still in recovery? I really shouldn't be doing that and learned a valiuable lesson. At least there is a warning with cocaine. There was none with heroin that I paid any attention to.

The little binge decimated me and since it was fishscale I didn't really realize how much I was doing, how high I got.I am absolutely done with everything, including alcohol for a very long time. Probably forever. I don't think I can handle a cup of coffee right now. I didn't hurt myself but it's scary that I wanted to. I reallyy strongly agree with avoiding these other harder type drugs that come with euphoria. I was definitely extremely euphoric for around 24 hours and then felt like I had been run over by a train afterwards. I kept prolonging the comedown and doing more,I still had a great time but I need to recover from this. Doing coke is not going to help my cause, I'm already walking on eggshells. Thanks for the encouragement this morning I was having crying spells and I guess that's the coke comedown but I'm not used to being that severely depressed that I lose track of everything going for me and want to escape by all means necessary. It was harsh as fuck for the little high I got, I'd have been better off doing heroin for 3 days in a row honestly. Really angry at myself, that shit is really stressful on the heart too. At least opiates don't damage the body outright like that stuff. I felt like I was severely damaged in 24 hours and it is day 2 from that, I slept through the morning with a little melatonin and added wild shrimp from Argentina into a massive veggie pasta this morning.

I read a lot on This post and it was very helpful... but don't read too much because a lot of people feel very negative about suboxone and it can make it worse when you are on day 3-4 of feeling like crapola and all you read is how the withdrawal seems to never end!!!

Anyone else can!! I am mentally and emotionally weak! But was strong enough to go though the worst feeling in my life... which wasn't even that bad... it was bearable yet unbearable if that makes any sense.You can kick suboxone if you want to!!!!!!! Ya you'll feel crappy for a couple to a few days!!!! But you will feel better when it's done!! I know I do!!! I feel like I have conquered my greatest weakness!I'm still tired and lazy! But I feel comfortable in my own skin now and I'm not moaning and groaning due to the discomforting feeling associated with the suboxone leaving my body.. I know It will take me another week or two until I have more energy! But I feel decent enough I can cycle around my neighbourhood to help increase my energy levels in the morning!

Ultimately I was still sick but couldn't walk straight or function with any real motor control or dexterity for 48 hrs. Near overdoses of phenobarb like that also leave a small rash on mucous membranes a few days later that take a week to clear up which was great to discover, not that it's an issue with non supra therapeutic doses .I would take it any day over something like a first generation antihistamine though and it should help get a few more zzz's in at night at least.

However, the MS Contin is so short-lived, I struggle to even be able to taper the slightest off my 220mg dose. So I really want to try to just stop cold turkey. I've discussed this for 3 years with my clinic, and they think that would be fine, as it's impossible for WD to be dangerous, according to them (even though I have multiple serious medical issues and a BMI of 18 due to gastric issues). I've just grown so tired of their 'maintenace' but no ideas as to how to help me off this crap.So I was considering just stopping the MS Contin from one day to another, but my question is, can I use small doses of methadone to ease the symptoms during that most intense week of WD? Would I just be prolonging the suffering, or would it make the week more bearable? Would I still detox, eventually not needing opiates?Say I quit the 220mg cold day 1, but took about 10mg methadone each day for a week, then stop the methadone, would that help?I ask out of sheer frustration with the Danish national health service, they have only two options: Stay on methadone, stop taking it.

Now this is certainly not my first cold turkey detox, so I have a fairly good idea of what to expect and when, or so I thought. The first day was more or less what I expected, then late starting last night/early this morning and continuing through now I have a strange symptom I have never encountered before, and in all honesty I haven't even read much of anything concerning this (I read a lot of articles). This new symptom is auditory and visual hallucinations. The visuals are pretty mile (my bedspread appeared to be flowing like a waterfare, a poster on the wall started dancing). The auditory have been worse. It sounds like someone has left a radio on in the adjacent room all the time, and occasionally I hear disembodied voices saying brief sentences to me like; \"you are supposed to be at work.\" I know these types of symptoms are typical for Alcohol, Benson, and even Barb withdrawal, but I have almost never heard of them happening in opioid withdrawal (and obviously never had them happen to me).I am quite worried about this happening, and I have no idea what to do about it.

It might mean some of the symptoms linger a little longer to a lesser degree at most. Think of it as a trade off of sorts. Honestly in your shoes I\u2019d probably either throw it out or eat it, I\u2019ve done both. I\u2019d suggest you try and push on through for a few more days. But if you take it, it will be far from the worst thing in the world and won\u2019t seriously set you back in terms of the detox, assuming we are only talk 5mg.Haha now that I\u2019ve reread your post, if you only have a few days until you get your scripts and you\u2019re just trying to make it to that point and then continue using them (regardless of how), you\u2019re better off just taking the 5mg. It probably won\u2019t be a huuuge difference, but it should help you feel a little better as you wait to get your meds. If you weren\u2019t going to be continuing to use opioids then I\u2019d say push through, but in this case just take it and try to get a bit of relief.Not sure if that is necessarily harm reduction advice, more just practical.

{"comment": "I've come off methadone (prescribed for pain management) before, although cold turkey although and at 20 times your dose and it was harsh to say the least..That is NOT the best way to so itWith regard to your situation, there is some evidence that the withdrawal from stopping at 10mg are just as bad as stopping at 30 or 40 so I wouldn't do that if you want to function. You say that you are feeling some withdrawls each drop but if you stop cold turkey they will be much worse. I wouldn't drop to 7.5 straight away as even though it's only a 2.5mg drop, it's 25% of your total daily dose which is a big drop (think in terms of percentages rather than mg).You say you have 250mg left? Some quick maths and I think you could drop 10mg every 5 days (9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, etc) and still have 25 mg spare for emergencies. This is a 45 day taper. When you get down to 1mg for 5 days then jump off..You then start the comfort meds for as long as the prescriptions you have last (2 weeks or so).With what you have available, this is the optimal way of doing it while keeping discomfort to a minimum. It will still be difficult but way easier than cold turkey. The problem is that you don't have enough methadone to do a longer taper and only a couple of weeks of comfort meds. If you stopped cold turkey now, the comfort meds would help but the withdrawls would last much longer than 2 weeks by which time you would be out of meds and in trouble.Hope that helps.", "date": "05-01-2018", "time": "10:40", "datetime": 1515148800},

{"comment": "I still feel like shit after 2 weeks.Over time, speaking in months and years, does the duration and recovery period tend to increase? I feel like whatever powerful energy reserves are required to detox are being depleted. This last relapse was two weeks and oxy's. I think the level of highness has something to do with it.I feel hopeless. I felt great around two weeks last time, and the time before, and the time before... I think it is wearing me out.", "date": "07-01-2018", "time": "14:36", "datetime": 1515335760},
{"comment": "Yeah shroomy it does get worse and takes longer to recover,  for me at least and many others say the same thing.The longer of a time period you are using opiates seems to directly correlate to how bad and how long the withdrawal lasts.I know what you mean about feeling like the powerful energy reserves needed to detox are being depleted. I think that is probably true. The brain also changes. More time = more change.I'm feeling pretty crummy too. Sorry you are so sick still. You said yourself that these are the worst days (8-12) so hopefully you will start feeling better today. I think you should consider a slow taper off the comfort Med's you have been using. Withdrawal from some of those might be just as bad or adding to how you are feeling. Slow and easy is the best way to go.If you think you are going to relapse on prescription day anyway then you should really consider getting a plan together and have your brother give you your daily medications for awhile and detox off everything a little more slowly. You are putting your body through a lot. Get yourself used to being stable. I hope you feel better real soon.", "date": "07-01-2018", "time": "15:15", "datetime": 1515338100},
{"comment": "Hey guys I used Hydrocodone 40-50 Mgs for about 4 years at least 5 times a week.  I am exactly 3 weeks from quitting cold turkey.  I don't have cravings at all but still feel awful at certain times during the day.  Some nausea, head pressure, dizzy just way off. (feels like a virus sometimes during the day) Then sometimes during the day I feel more like normal.  Can anyone relate or give me some advice?  I am never going back but want to feel better.", "date": "16-02-2018", "time": "18:49", "datetime": 1518806940},
{"comment": "I'm hoping someone is still here on this thread. I have a few questions. I posted back in August and fell on my face before I even got started. I continued using pills and kept telling myself that the docs wanted me to. In October my lil brother took his life and I have been just clutching these pills as a life line. It has taken me over 5 months to get back to even being willing to give up the pills. If I don't I'm gonna follow him. I know and feel it every day.  I was prescribed 10mg oxycontin twice daily and two 5mg hydrocodone, I also usually add in another 15mg of oxycodone. I told my doctor that while i had been unable to get to pharmacy for two days I had been able to borrow and get by on 4 oxycodone. She was more than willing to change my meds considering I was reducing it. It's now been 13 days without the oxycontin or hydro and I want to find a way to come off the last 4pills a day. I expected to have more withdrawal symptoms that I did as I've been taking these for almost 7years. I was achy, exhausted and randomly felt sick but no vomiting. I'm assuming this is due to still having the 20mg a day. I can't comment on depression as I think in as low as I can get these last few months. Shouldn't dropping these two meds have been far worse? Can anyone tell me the best way to go from here, maybe taper? Would cold turkey be similar to what I just experienced, or still far worse?", "date": "06-04-2018", "time": "06:04", "datetime": 1522994640},
{"comment": "So you're taking 35mg oxy/ day and 10mg hydro? Now youre at 20mg oxy/day ?If ^that's the case I wouldnt imagine you'd feel many wd symptoms, perhaps slightly.Cold turkey will hurt, I'd def taper down, maybe even see if your doc is willing to script you diazepam or clonidine.", "date": "06-04-2018", "time": "07:05", "datetime": 1522998300},
{"comment": "ss373dOH, that's correct I'm now on just 20mg of oxycodone. It's weird but I'm really relieved to be away from the 12hr. I had assumed that would have been the hard part for me. For whatever reason that has given me some hope as well as focused energy. I definitely want to try to taper, bit just don't want to do it in a way that I more or less make myself nuts. I figured someone here might be able to explain the best way or timing. My docs aren't going to assist as both feel meds are needed. They may be right to some degree but I need to feel something again, beyond anger n numbness if that makes sense.", "date": "07-04-2018", "time": "19:31", "datetime": 1523129460},
